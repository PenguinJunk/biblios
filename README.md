# Introduction 
Principally to add version control to izzy's bibtex file but it could be amazing if everyone added their reading/watching/listening notes to this repo

# Getting Started
Just git pull the repo to where you want to have access to the .bib and other files. Edit and then git push.

# Contribute
Do it! Maybe add your own file - could be .ris, .bib or something else
