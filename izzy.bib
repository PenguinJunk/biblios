  title        = {The Enigma of Reason: A New Theory of Human Understanding},
  publisher    = {Harvard University Press},
  comment      = {Discusses reason, its purpose and evolution and how it manifests in human societies. Find that it is a ``tool to convince others and not less importantly a tool for evaluating the arguments others produce to convince us'': p331-332. Reason has evolved to benefit individuals - either by convincing and influencing others and also by evaluating the justifications and arguments given by others: p333. However, much like other evolved features can manifest outside of this proper _domain_, manifesting in the _actual_ domain. ``The proper domain of reasoning is disagreements between oneself and others - clashes of ideas...The actual domain of reasoning, the kind of input that triggers its operations, is. we have argued, the detection of a clash of ideas'': p289-290.  

Reason has been the focus of philosophy and psychology for millennia. Most works argues that reason has an intellectual purpose - to weigh up justifications and produced good, unbiased decisions making. However, the evidence from studies is that reasoning is ``biased - people overwhelmingly find reasons that support their previous beliefs - and it is lazy - people do not carefully scrutinize their own reasons'': p247. When people make choices based on reasons, the results can be worse than using intuition p216-218 ``when people have weak or conflicting intuitions, reason drives them towards the decision for which it is easiest to find reason - the decisions that they can best justify'': p255. 

Starts with introduction of representations and of modules that enable cognition and reasoning. ``Representations are material things, such as activation of groups of neurons in a brain, magnetic patterns in an electronic storage medium, or ink patterns in a piece of paper. They can be inside an organism or in its environment. What makes such a material thing a representation is not its location, its shape, or its structure it is its function. A representation has the function of providing an organisation (or, more generally, any information-processing device) with information about some state of affairs'' p81 

''Metarepresentational modules provide information not only about the representations metarepresented but also, indirectly, these modules have very specific domains, namely, specific aspects of specific kinds of representations... `` p 104  

''The main role of reasons is not to motivate or guide us in reaching conclusions but to explain and justify after the fact the conclusions we have reached'' p112 ``[a review of] a rich range of evidence showing that we have little or no introspective access to our own mental processes and that our verbal reports of these processes are often confabulations'' p114-115 

Inference is deeply linked to reason, in fact reason cannot be achieved without inference at some level - all reasons are inferred, or the reason for these reasons are inferred: p132. ``One of the main claims of this book is that reasoning is not an alternative to intuitive inference; reasoning is use of intuitive inferences about reasons'': p133. ``We infer what our reasons much have been from the conclusions we intuitively arrived at'': p141. 

There have been many different views of reasoning, including probabilistic - and more specifically Bayesian - form of thinking (Oaksford and Chater): p165. Discusses the purpose of reason from an evolutionary perspective. Whilst ancient philosophers would see reason as distinguishing humans from animals, ``The functional effects of reason are roughly the same for Darwin as they were for Aristotle. What is new with Darwin, however, is the use of the effects to explain why reason should have evolved'': p179.  

There's quite a bit of discussion of this including those who believe that reason is a flawed feature. But the book draws the conclusion that ``Reason fulfils two main functions. One function helps solve a major problem of coordination by producing justifications. The other function helps solve a major problem of communication by producing arguments'' (argumentative theory of reasoning): p183. ``The ability to produce and evaluate reasons has not evolved in order to improve psychological insight but as a tool for defending or criticising thoughts and actions, for expressing commitments and for creating mutual expectations. The main function of attributing reasons is to justify oneself and to evaluate the justification of others'': p186. 

The development of idea of the lone reasoner has ``obscured the degree to which reasoning (including scientific reasoning) is a social activity, and the degree to which it is based on intuitions'': p198. 

From studies ``intuitions aimed at gathering the most useful information while reasoning aimed at confirming the participants' stereotypes'': p218. However, this is not so much confirmation bias as ``myside bias''. ``people have no general preference for confirmation. What they find difficult is not looking for counterevidence or counterarguments in general, but only when what is being challenged is their own opinion'': p218. 

The interactionist view of reason explains that better reasons are obtained by argumentation. Weak justifications and arguments, which require less energy to come by, are soon rejected by both sides and the arguers develop better reasons to support their ideas (or their minds are changed) p228. This approach takes less effort and is much more effective than trying to obtain all the arguments alone. Also, people are not good at evaluating the value of their own reasons. However, ``The fact that people are good at evaluating others; reasons is the nail in the coffin of the intellectualist approach. It means that people have the ability to reason objectively, rejecting weak arguments and accepting strong ones but that they do not use these skills on the reasons they produce'': p235. Being biased and lazy, spells disaster for the lone reasoner ... lead to extreme positions'': p247. 

However, ``groups can have disappointing performance not only when pooling physical force but also in a variety of cognitive problems. Brainstorming is a typical example. By and large, group brainstorming doesn't work. In a typical brainstorming session, participants are told not to voice their criticisms, so that they feel free to suggest even wild ideas. This doesn't work: a brainstorming group typically generates fewer and worse ideas then if the ideas of each individual working in isolation had been gathered. By contrast, telling people that 'most studies suggest that you should debate and even criticise each other's ideas' allows them ot produce more ideas'': p266.  

Groups work best when debate is permitted even difficult problems such as predicting geopolitics - groups in which individuals saw the average of their peer's predictions worked better than those who made predictions alone, but those who were allowed to debate rather than just see an average were better still: p270. 

There is even evidence that children who are reasoned with, rather than persuaded using authority, have better outcomes (this could be correlation and not necessarily causation): p291. Also, students who spent time in debate did better than those spending equivalent time essay-writing, even though their writing style was poorer: p298. Also, good evidence that involving citizens in debates about issues that matter results in people who are not only ``better informed and more articulate, but also have a deeper understanding of other people's point of view'': p309-310 [citizens assemblies] (Fishkin 2009, Landemore 2013, Mercier and Landemore 2012). 

Reasoning on the abolition of slavery is given special scrutiny, noting that the anti-abolitionists strongest arguments weren't moral but economic [as with today's anti-environment arguments]. 

The good and the bad of reasoning even applies to scientists, who will find arguments to explain away weak results p318 but will also change their minds when presented with good arguments p319. Looking at so-called solitary geniuses reveals that they were far from solitary and developed their ideas in collaboration with others either by direct discussion or correspondence or by reading their work p322.},

AI concerns are
- epistemic - the probabilistic nature of insights, the inherent inscrutability of `black box' algorithms, and the fallibility of the data used for training and input
- normative - fairness of decisional outcomes, erosion of informational privacy, and increasing surveillance and profling of individuals

Phases of AI ethics
 - 2016 to 2019 - high-level ethical principles for AI published such as catalogues of ethical principles and frameworks for ethical, trustworthy responsible AI. These might best address the impacts of AI and data-driven systems framed as applied ethics. Dominated by a philosophical approach as opposed to legal or technical approach.
- A second phase saw a more technical approach from the computer science community. Focus on fairness, accountability and transparency, `ethical-by-design'
- current phase is a move `from what to how', proposals for governance mechanisms, regulation, impact assessment, auditing tools and standards leading to the ability to assure and ultimately, insure AI systems
- latterly a shift towards acknowledgement of political, social and justice issues `beyond the principled and the technical, to practical mechanisms for rectifying power imbalances'

This paper uses audit and assurance practises from other sectors, like financial services, to identify gaps in current ethical impact assessment and audit practises.

''Risks in AI can manifest as either underusing the technology and missing out on value creation and innovation, or overusing/misusing the technology''

First identified 169 ethics documents.
Reduced these to only those ``that s that would give an organisation or practitioner a concrete tool to apply to AI production or deployment'' resulting in a set of 39 documents.

Created some useful typologies:
- stakeholder types
- tool types for impact assessment
- tool types for audits
- processes that were inspected internally vs those that allowed for external inspection
- technical design tools (workshop materials, documentation or technical tools)
- when tool used and if applied to data and/or model

Key fndings:
- The focus has moved from data to models from 2017 to 2020
- Stakeholder types using the tools are limited to those closely related to doing the work
- There is little participation in the assessment or audit process by certain stakeholder groups 
- Only one tool requires external assessment (IEEE)
- Techniques and practices deployed by other forms of Impact Assessment (like EIAs) are not present or rarely suggested in ethical AI impact assessments
- Checklists/questionnaires are ubiquitous across Impact Assessment tools

  abstract         = {Urbanization is the second largest mega-trend right after climate change. Accurate measurements of urban morphological and demographic figures are at the core of many international endeavors to address issues of urbanization, such as the United Nations' call for “Sustainable Cities and Communities”. In many countries - particularly developing countries -, however, this database does not yet exist. Here, we demonstrate a novel deep learning and big data analytics approach to fuse freely available global radar and multi-spectral satellite data, acquired by the Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 satellites. Via this approach, we created the first-ever global and quality controlled urban local climate zones classification covering all cities across the globe with a population greater than 300,000 and made it available to the community (https://doi.org/10.14459/2021mp1633461). Statistical analysis of the data quantifies a global inequality problem: approximately 40\% of the area defined as compact or light/large low-rise accommodates about 60\% of the total population, whereas approximately 30\% of the area defined as sparsely built accommodates only about 10\% of the total population. Beyond, patterns of urban morphology were discovered from the global classification map, confirming a morphologic relationship to the geographical region and related cultural heritage. We expect the open access of our dataset to encourage research on the global change process of urbanization, as a multidisciplinary crowd of researchers will use this baseline for spatial perspective in their work. In addition, it can serve as a unique dataset for stakeholders such as the United Nations to improve their spatial assessments of urbanization.},
  comment          = {Perform ``urban local climate zones classification'' (LCZ) on Sentinel-1 (SAR) and Sentinel-2 data using deep CNN.

The So2Sat LCZ42 benchmark dataset has 17 classes describing largely the building character (compact high-rise, open mid-rise, lightweight low-raise (favela?), etc plus non urban - dense trees, bare rock/paved, etc) labelled manually - with rigorous QA - for 42 urban agglomerations and other areas.

Model is two residual CNNs, one for sentinel-2 input including up to 4 seasons and the other for sentinel-1, 1 season input. Each CNNs produces a 17 vector preduction for which the mean across the predictions is input to the softmax.

Evidence is that sentinel-1 adds very little (but something) to classification. Probably would be better if it were higher spatial resolution.

Assessment is performed using 3 different splits of the data:
random-split - the data were split into train-test using random function across all examples - this would be the upper bound of achievable classification accuracy - this would give a representative measure of accuracy for unseen cities whose data distribution is similar to the training cities
block-split - urban agglomerations were split into non-overlapping train-test areas
held-out cultural-10 split - some agglomerations were entirely withheld - this would be the lower bound of the achievable accuracy by evaluating completely held-out data in a cross-validation scheme

Urban morphology is analysed by viewing the classified images for different urban regions.

Found very different proportions of people live in different population densities: ``60\% of the population live in compact and lightweight/large low-rise areas, occupying 40\% of the built up area. Another 35\% of the population lives in open or sparsely built areas, occupying 55\% of the areas. The remaining 5\% of the population is distributed in the non-built-up LCZ classes. This huge difference in population density reflects a possible inequality in living conditions''.

A clustering is performed on cities based on the quantity and spatial location of LCZs across all cities and identify some characteristics patterns which given the following labels:
European Cities
Cities of the Islamic world
Predominantly Chinese cities
Predominantly African cities
European-African-Asian cities
Very large cities

They do talk a bit about urban heat islands and the climatic impact of urban areas but I don't really understand why these particular classes are referred to as local climate zones.},

It traditionally relies on remotely sensed imagery and therefore models land cover classes with respect to their electromagnetic reflectances, aggregated in pixels. This paper introduces a methodology which enables the inclusion of geographical object semantics (from vector data) into the LULC classification procedure. As such, information on the types of geographic objects (e.g., Shop, Church, Peak, etc.) can improve LULC classification accuracy. In this paper, we demonstrate how semantics can be fused with imagery to classify LULC. Three experiments were performed to explore and highlight the impact and potential of semantics for this task. In each experiment CORINE LULC data was used as a ground truth and predicted using imagery from Sentinel-2 and semantics from LinkedGeoData using deep learning. Our results reveal that LULC can be classified from semantics only and that fusing semantics with imagery—Semantic Boosting—improved the classification with significantly higher LULC accuracies. The results show that some LULC classes are better predicted using only semantics, others with just imagery, and importantly much of the improvement was due to the ability to separate similar land use classes. A number of key considerations are discussed.},

Consider learning across domains that include:
ImageNet
CropDisease
EuroSAT
ISIC (medical imagery)
ChestX (x-rays)

Measure similarity of domains using criteria:
1) existence of perspective distortion
2) the semantic content
3) color depth

The datasets include agriculture images (natural images, but specific to agriculture industry), satellite (loses perspective distortion), dermatology (loses perspective distortion, and contains different semantic content), and radiological images (different according to all 3 criteria).

Evaluate several few-shot learning approaches:
- Meta-learning (e.g. MatchingNet and MAML for single-domain cases and Feature-wise transform and Adversarial Domain Adaptation with Reinforced Sample Selection in cross-domain cases) are approaches for which the aim of training is to learn how to learn a new task easily
- transfer learning, from a single model includes: fixed feature extractor, fine-tuning all layers, fine-tuning last-k layers, transductive fine-tuning
- Transfer from Multiple Pre-trained Models, includes methods to select the most useful features from a library of pre-trained models for each task

Best results are for IMS-f which is a method of transferring from multiple pre-trained models and involves fine-tuning each pretrained model before applying model selection. The other fine-tuning methods also work well. Fixed feature extractor works little better than a random embedding (and MatchingNet performs less well than random embedding). Results are better for those target domains that are more similar to the source domain.},

  comment          = {Demostrates masses of evidence that, once societies have reached a level of prosperity, it is not wealth that influences good outcomes (good health, low violence, ...) but the level of equality. Also, draws on other research to provide clear explanation of why this is.

After the first edition was published, there were a number of criticisms, each of which is addressed in a new chapter. At the end of this, comments on the rise of neo-liberal political and economic thinking which pushed out egalitarian ideas in the 1980 and 1990s. However, demonstrates how the content of The Spirit Level is now influencing politics: ``In a major speech a the end of 2009, David Cameron said The Spirit Level showed 'that among the richest countries, it's the more unequal ones that do worse according to almost every life indicator''. ``In September 2010 ... Ed Miliband said ' I do believe this country is too unequal and the gap between rich and poor doesn't just harm the poor, it harms us all'' p298

Uses the same set of the worlds richest countries, as well as US states, and looks at relationship between income inequality (there are many possible measures of inequality, but they don't make much difference p17) and an index of health and social problems, which combined:
- level of trust
- mental illness (inc drug and alcohol addiction)
- life expectancy and infant mortality
- obesity
- children's educational performance
- teenage births
- homicides
- imprisonment rates
- social mobility (not available for US states)
p19

Also, UNICEF index of child wellbeing (for which UK scores bottom out of this set of wealth countries)

Health and social problems occur in individuals and the book describes how it is the individual's response to the social inequality that is the cause. People always have a sense of their rank within society. Anxiety has been rising over time. So has self-esteem. However, there seem to be two groups of people with high self-esteem. One group has positive outcomes, but another ``showed tendencies to violence, racism, who were insensitive to others and were bad a personal relationships'' p37. This second group are the self-promoters p44. The rise in anxiety has been accompanied with rising narcissism, both having roots in 'social evaluative threat' p37. A study of experiments into effects of stress on individuals have found that the most consistent stressors are threats to self-esteem and social status p38. 

Later in the book, it links these responses to inequality with our genetic make up. Psychology/economics experiments show how people will choose to gain nothing rather than accept an unfair offer p202. Chimps and Bonobos are our genetically closest species and yet they have different social structures ``The chimpanzee resolves secual issues with power; the bonobo resolves power issues with sex''. In the section of DNA that regulates these characteristics, humans are closer to the bonobo p205. Humans are preoccupied by social interaction because this is of paramount importance p206. Mirror neurons trigger small muscle responses to what we see others do (and thus we can empathise) p213. Social exclusion results in the same response as physical pain p214.

Looks at the different health and social indicators, each of which has a strong relationship to inequality:

Level of trust - different Inequality also correlates levels of distrust, with resulting poor outcomes for communities. Probably distrust is an outcome of inequality but also this may lead to feedback that further decreases equality p62.

Mental illness - this is affected by our judgement of ourselves and how we believe others view us and levels of trust

Physical health and life expectancy - social status, social networks and stress in early childhood are the psychosocial factors in determining the health of a population, in wealthy countries p77 There is no relationship between the amount of spending on healthcare per person and life expectancy p81

Obesity - its not just about calories and the amount of exercise, stress also seems to cause the body to metabolise differently p95 ``The Thrifty Phenotype'', triggered by stressed conditions pre-birth, has lower metabolic rate p100

Educational performance - more family conflict and disruption in low-income families (due to the reasons above i.e. trust, health) can affect learning p111 but also children are acutely aware of social status and this directly affects outcomes p113

Teenage pregnancy - one factor is that parenthood is the way that young women join the adult world and gain a status, when educational outcomes are poorer

Violence - interestingly, in US states, the relationship between homicide rates and inequality was greater if the rate of gun owndership was factored in (i.e. access to a gun has a relationship to homicide rate too)

Imprisonment - more unequal societies have longer sentences but these do not deter people from crime p153. More equal societies tend to design their criminal justice systems with consultation from experts - criminalogists, lawyers, prison psychiatrists and psychologists p155. Media and political pressure have a greater influence in more unequal societies p156.

The different ways that countries achieve equality of income - scandinavian countries tend to redistribute using taxes and benefits whereas Japan  has a greater equality of market incomes but the health and social outcomes are the same p184

Social status and friendship are linked to health outcomes, strength of community life and violence. Social status and friendship are two opposite ways that humans come together - either by stratification with privileged access to resources, regardless of need or by reciprocity, mutuality, sharing, social obligations, co-operations and recognitions of each others' needs  p199-200

Inequality and the environment: Simple view of development demonstrates that above a certain level of CO2 emissions there is no improvement in life expectancy p219 A great deal of what drives consumption is status competition p226.

''It is often suggested that invention and innovation go with inequality and depend on the promise of individual financial incentives. However, Figure 15.3 suggests the contrary - that more equal societies ten to be more creative'' p225

consumption is a substitute for status, growth is a substitute for equality, more equality makes growth less necessary p226

The things that matter are health, happiness, friendship, community life. But cutting carbon emissions, limiting economic growth in rich countries, is not just having fewer luxuries, inequality has to be reduced simultaneously p231.

More equal societies more public spirited  p232

''to give ourselves the best chance of making the necessary transformation of society we need to remember that the aim is to make a more sociable society, which means avoiding the disruption and dislocation which increase insecurity and fear and so often end in a disastrous backlash'' p237.

''A study which analysed trends in inequality during the 1980s and 1990s ... found that the most important single factor was trade union membership'' p245.

''Although some profit-making businesses have high ethical standards, the institutional framework, seem to invite them to an exploitative relationship with society'' p254.

''To make a reliable difference to company performance, share-ownership has to be combined with more participative management methods'' p256

Inequality, a sense of unfairness and having less control at work has detrimental impact on health outcomes p256

''If Britain became as equal as [the average of Japan, Norway, Sweden and Finland], levels of trust might be expected to be two-thirds as high again as they are now, mental illness might be more than halved, everyone would get an addition year of life, teenage birth rates could fall to one-third of what they are now, homicide rates could fall by 75 per cent, everyone could ge thte equivalent of almost seven weeks extra holiday a year and the government could b closing prisons all over the country'' p268-269.},

Interesting and galvanising, with a lot of practical 'how to'.
The one aspect that I didn't quite follow was that it talk about long-run growth (e.g. p 164) without saying what that is or what happens when it ultimately ceases. 

Contents gives a lot away:

Capitalism is in crisis:
- Finance is financing FIRE (finance, insurance and real estate)
- Business is focussing on quarterly returns
- The planet is warming
- Governments are tinkering, not leading

Five myths that impeded progress:
- Businesses create value and take risks; governments only de-risk and facilitate
- The purpose of government is to fix market failures
- Government needs to un like a business
- Outsourcing saves taxpayer money and lowers risk
- Governments shouldn't pick winners

Lessons from Apollo
- Leadership: vision and purpose
- Innovation: risk-taking and experimentation
- Organisational change: agility and flexibility
- Spillovers: serendipity and collaboration
- Finance: outcomes-based budgeting
- Business and the state: partnership with a common purpose

Mission-oriented Policies on Earth
- Selecting a mission
- Implementing a mission
- Engaging citizens in a mission
- Mission: a Green New Deal
- Mission: innovating for accessible health
- Mission: narrowing the digital divide

Seven principles for a new political economy
- Value: collectively created
- Markets: shaping not fixing
- Organisations: dynamic capabilities
- Finance: outcomes-based budgeting
- Distribution: sharing risks and rewards
- Partnership: purpose and stakeholder value
- Participation: open systems to co-design our future

a mission-oriented approach ``means choosing directions for the economy and then putting the problems that need solving to get there at the centre of how we design our economic systems'' p8 (this seems analogous to me to the optimisation function alluded to in Stuart Russell's 4th Reith Lecture Russell2021d)

only about a fifth of finance goes into the productive economy p16

Much of current economic thinking is based on Market Failure Theory, which states that markets are the most efficient allocators of resources under three specific  conditions:
1. there is a complete set of markets
2. all consumers and producers behave competitively
3. equilibrium exists (e.g. supply exactly matches demand)
and the only role of government to correct for external positive or negative externalities or information asymmetries
In addition to this, Public Choice Theory, assumes that agents, including government agents, are also self-interested. This means that policy-making is subject to capture by interest groups (because collective action by voters tends to be weak and voters are not very interested) resulting in
- neopotism
- cronyism
- corruption
- rent-seeking
- misallocation of resources
- unfair and damaging competition (crowding out)
Therefore, the conditions that indicate a government should intervene need to outweigh losses of government failure.
Yet there is no empirical evidence for this, even though these theories are used to prevent government taking amitious steps.
p 31 - 33

New Public Management theory is used to justify government being run like a business such as by having cost-benefit analysis of any allocation of funding p25-37

This is why we should have research functions in public sector: ``The key role of NASA is to define the mission, plan the programme, be clear on the guidelines, set the parameters and then allow as much innovation as possible to create the product or service required. None of this could ave been done without the NASA staff themselves having experience of the underlying science and technology; In fact, it would have been impossible to choose contrator intelligently without that knowledge. Additionally, by developing internal expertise, contracts with the private sector would be better managed because those writing them would know just as much about the technology as the contractors'' p 95

''having a vision is not enough, it is essential to engage with citizens about it'' p109

The Sustainable Development Goals SDGs make good missions because they require work over many domains: social, political, technological, behavioural and feedback processes. They also are broken down in to 169 targets. p110

Often innovation policy is focussed on outcomes, such as support for a particular technology. Instead, focus should be on the problem to be solved - the technology and start-ups will follow p111

Describes how to build a mission-map
Grand challenge - what needs solving - e.g. climate change
Mission - what the solution looks like - e.g. 100 carbon neutral European cities by 2030
Sectors - the difficult sectors that needs to be engaged - e.g. real estate, energy, mobility, ...
Mission projects - breaking down the mission to components - e.g. building with carbon neutral components, clean urban electric mobility, ...
p112-114

Mazzucato advised UK Government on how to apply a mission-oriented approach, leading to 2017 Industrial Strategy: Building a Britain fit for the future p117

A mission needs to:
- be bold and inspirational, with societal relevance
- set goals for investment in innovation
- encourage mutltiple solutions
p121-124

Mission implementation requires:
- policy instruments that focus on outcomes and foster innovation
- new approach to governance to includes public finance as investor of first resort
- Appropriate indicators and monitoring frameworks
- A change in how private and public sectors work together
''It is not about government bringing in the private sector to show how public research leads to commercialisation. Most commercialisation opportunities from public research - such as development of the software industry following Appollo - occurred precisely when government kept its eye on the prize and did not worry about the economic value or commercialisation what would result''
p124-130

Citizens need to be engaged not just in the ideas but the design and assessment of the mission. This is collaborative participatory and may require frank debates. But it also must avoid the capture by vested interests. It may not be harmonious but it must represent all perspectives, not just those of the 'elite' experts. p132-137

''Mainstream economic prescriptions of simply solving climate change with a carbon tax and some R\&D subsidies (to let the markest find the optimal pathway), combined with political conomic impediments to carbon taxes, have left us with negligent carbon tax systems and a worryingly slow green transition'' p142

''As behavioural science has shown (and the rader knows from everyday life), real persons do not normally optimally react to price incentives, and they tend to 'satisfice' rather than maximise profits or measures of happiness at every step of the way'' p142

In mainstream economic approaches, the costs are socialised (government funds the research and shoulders the risk) while the profits are privatised (shareholders receive the rewards) p147

''Scientific and medical innovation thrives and progress is made when knowledge is exchanged openly, building upon shared successes and failures. But proprietary science does not follow that logic: it promote secretive competition, prioritises crossing regulatory finishing lines in wealthy countries over wide availability ... and erects barriers to technological diffusion'' p150

'''Wicked' problems cannot be solved in a linear way, and there is no tech solution to social problems'' p154

''The mission attitude is not about picking individual sectors to support but about identifying problems that can catalyse collaboration beween many different sectors'' p159

On outsourcing during Covid-19 pandemic: ``By relying on consultancy firms to manage the test-and-trace system, the government has not only deprived our brilliant civil servants of an opprtunity to demosntrate and develop their knowledge, but in doing so undermined the possiblity of organisation learning through the crisis'' p177

- Co-ordination
- Administration

  comment          = {I thought this was a really excellent paper that explored the impact of pretraining (the upstream task) to the accuracy of the downstream tasks. They performed a large empirical study looking at a range of different algorithms, datasets and downstream tasks they identify that there appears to be an upper limit of accuracy on the downstream (DS) task. Find upstream accuracy is not a predictor of downstream accuracy and that optimal parameters for the upstream task may be at odds with those for the downstream tasks. Specifically, it may be necessary to hurt the accuracy of the upstream model to gain better downstream results or to select the upstream model for the specific downstream tasks. This behaviour is closely related to the usefulness of representations in higher layers of the upstream model. Say that ``ultimately the problem is down to data diversity''and so I presume this means that the problem is that the downstream task is out-of-distribution.

Again this is relevant to \os's work pretraining models and emphasises that striving for a highly accurate backbone model is probably unnecessary. Rather, it may be worth building multiple benchmark problems to test different backbones and transfer learning approach against will help us establish what are the best approaches to upstream and downstream training. 

From The Batch:

The authors re-examined 4,800 experiments performed on diverse architectures: Vision Transformers, MLP-Mixers, and ResNets. The models had been pretrained to classify labeled images in JFT or ImageNet 21K. They were tested on 25 tasks, including classifying objects, classifying the orientation of objects, and diagnosing diabetic retinopathy, after fine-tuning via few-shot learning or transfer learning. In few-shot learning, the last layer was replaced and trained on 25 examples. In transfer learning, the whole network was fine-tuned on 1,000 examples.

For each model and fine-tuned task, the authors plotted pretrained accuracy on the horizontal axis and fine-tuned accuracy on the vertical axis. The resulting swaths of clustered dots generally rose nonlinearly until they reached a plateau. 
The authors calculated a curve to match the best results in each task. Then they extended that line to extrapolate fine-tuned accuracy if pretrained accuracy were 100 percent.
In their own experiments, they varied the size of the pretraining set (JFT), number of parameters in the model (Vision Transformer), and number of epochs in pretraining. Then they repeated the steps above. 
Results: Higher pretrained accuracy generally yielded higher fine-tuned accuracy — but it reached a point of diminishing returns. In some cases, higher pretrained accuracy yielded worse fine-tuned accuracy. Moreover, pretrained models of equal accuracy didn't necessarily perform equally well on different fine-tuned tasks. The authors' own experiments matched the curves they derived from earlier work, leading them to conclude that dataset size, number of parameters in a model, and length of training don't significantly influence the relationship between pretrained and fine-tuned accuracy.

Why it matters: More pretraining doesn't necessarily result in a better fine-tuned model.

We're thinking: One limiting factor in the value of pretraining accuracy may be the relevance of the pretrained task to the fine-tuned task. No matter how well a model classifies ImageNet, it may not easily learn how to diagnose medical images. A rigorous framework for managing the tradeoff between pretraining and fine-tuning would be useful.},

Looking at the impact of pretraining (upstream (US) task) on the accuracy of the downstream task.

In many ways, there's logic in this because Semantic Segmentation using convolutions has had to overcome the problem that convolutions reduce the resolution of the output. However, convoutions address the limitations of dense predictors such as MLPs (and transformers) by reducing the number of learnable parameters and allowing flexibility in the input data size and spatial scale (because they don't need to learn a set of weights for each input pixel position). This method overcomes these limitations of MLP by performing some sort of cycling over the sampling space.

They identified different methods of reducing the number of synaptic updates. One interesting discovery was that initialising the network with weights extracted from the distribution of weights of a previously trained networks massively reduces the number of required updates over initialising with standard Kaiming Normal. They suggest that this is analogous to evolution choosing better initial brain conditions.

It could be worth us at \os looking at weight distributions in our trained networks and seeing if this is useful for prescribing a weight initialiser for our networks.},

Find that initialising brain with ``artificial genome'' by compressing trained weights to distribution which proved much better ``at birth'' than Kaiming Normal weight initialisation (54\% initial predictivity without training). Reduce synaptic updates by freezing earlier brain units - downstream training - or even by freezing all but the final layer of brain units - critical training. Downstream training reduces score but critical training is nearly as good as full training but only requires 5\% of parameters. Final score is 79\% brain predictivity but with only .5\% of the updates. The ``at birth'' initialisation is especially interesting as it may be analogous to brain pre-wiring in primates - and could be something we apply for weight init.},

Most popular approaches are finetuning (retrain whole model) or linear probing (only tune the new head). It seems that when the downstream tasks uses data that are in-distribution case, fine tuning works best. However, linear probing works better for out-of-distribution (OOD) data. One reason for this is the new head is initialised with random weights which cause too much adjustment to the pretrained weights. They therefore suggest Linear Probing - Fine Tuning (LP-FT), a hybrid approach which tunes the new head first before finetuning the backbone so that the weights in the head are more attuned to the pretrained weights.

This is relevant to \os should we be using pretraining more to create backbones that are then deployed for data from different sensors or platforms.

  comment          = {Whilst this paper is aiming to train networks to be deployed onto identifying different views of the same thing (multiview learning), it seems more generally applicable to me for improving results for downstream tasks which may be somewhat out of domain. Often, classifiers misclassify images because they have learned some spurious aspect of the context, e.g. they use snow in the image to label the dog as a husky. This can mean they fail when the context is unusual, such as classifying a cow when it appears on a beach. To address this, this paper proposes a training approach that maximises that correlation been images of the same class (husky, cow) which then encourages the shared information between examples to be more relevant to the class. This approach also provides the ability to extract the `private`/background, uncorrelated information.},

Intuition is given with classification of an image of a cow (content) on the beach (context), which can fail because cows in the training data are usually on grass. Using this approach they maximise correlation in similar way to DeepCC and Barlow Twins and find that this is a good objective.

  comment          = {In a production set-up, ideally a backbone network would be learning continually as new data come in. However, if learning is supervised this requires continuously labelling data. Further, as the domain drifts, ``catastrophic forgetting'' can lead to a model that can no longer perform tasks it was previously good at. This paper looks at solutions to both these and finds that Lifelong Unsupervised Mixup (LUMP) (they also tried Dark Experience Replay) in combination with Barlow Twins (they also tried SimSiam) produces a backbone that responses well over time to a range of downstream tasks. 

I think this paper is very relevant to \os's future use of machine learning for image interpretation. It addresses sets out an approach to continually updating backbone networks, as new data are acquired, which doesn't require new labels to be produced.

  comments         = {Oral From <https://iclr.cc/virtual/2022/oral/7120> I think this paper is very relevant to OS's use of machine learning for image interpretation. It addresses the issue of continual learning in the case from visual data posted on the web which is unlabelled and for which new problems need to be addressed (e.g. finding real world features for which previous model have not been created). I see that as how we should ultimately be working at OS, we have data continually coming in from different platforms and we want to be able to address new customer problems as they arise. The problem is, to learn for one problem can require a lot of labelled data and can also not help future problems. And as we move onto future problems, ``catastrophic forgetting'' may occur which means that our models stop being able to solve for earlier problems. This paper addresses this using Unsupervised Continual Learning (UCL). They take self-supervised models SimSiam and Barlow Twins (yay, we know about those :-) ) to address the labelling problem - learning representations that can then be used to solve problems as they arise (e.g. as a backbone network). Investigate solutions to catastrophic forgetting by revisiting representations learned on previous tasks: - structural regularization (encourage current task parameters to stay close to previous parameters) - unsupervised replay using Dark Experience Replay (DER) to minimise the Euclidian distance between projected output of current unlabelled task and replay buffer (earlier inputs) task - and propose Lifelong Unsupervised Mixup (LUMP) which interpolates between the examples in the current task and random examples from the replay buffer Using CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100 and Split Tiny-ImageNet problems they assess accuracy and forgetting over successive problems for different approaches against a baseline of finetuning the backbone Find that unsupervised approaches perform better than supervised approaches for accuracy and forgetting. The use of LUMP also results in better performance over all other methods. Barlow Twins with LUMP appears to be the best combination for forgetting and is fairly equivalent for accuracy. Evidence that UCL, especially with LUMP, learning more distinctive features (by visual inspection) and also has a loss landscape that is stable and robust (remains consistent over subsequent tasks).

This paper investigates their application in improving training of AlexNets although I'm unconvinced by the results which seem to show that Batch Normalization has the greater impact. However, possibly more interesting and relevant to this section, is that this paper also looks at how well the manifold of each network node separates the classes (its capacity). They find that this varies through the depth with a steep increase at final layers, which may be expected, but is a result of highly varying changes in dimensionality of manifolds and the correlation between manifolds. They also measure the sparsity of the model using the Gini index, finding all models are sparse in the final layer.},

Look at capacity of manifolds for each neuron - the number of separable categories per neuron. This shows that capacity is low for early and intermediate layers but rises steeply in the final layers. This breaks down to high dimensionality (less easy to distinguish) at low at early layer, which increases in intermediate layers and then rapidly drops in final layers. The correlation between manifolds drops to very low (manifolds are farther from each other) at early layers, increases in intermediate layers and then drops off for final layers. Sparsity - measure using Gini index (inequality of income). DN increases sparsity (a bit) through network but at the final layer all models are as sparse.},

  comment          = {The fact that siamese networks can be trained without negative examples and yet do not collapsing (`dimensional collapse``) to some trivial solution was considered by this paper. The the first approach not to use negative examples was SimSiam (\cite{ChenH2021}) who said that this was because they didn't backpropogate the gradient over one of the encoders (called ``stop gradient``). However, this work finds that the real reason is to do with opposition in the directions of two components of the representation vector (the centre component and the residual). They also refute the claim in work similar to SimSiam, BYOL (Bootstrap Your On Latent) ~\cite{GrillEtAl2020} that batch normalisation is essential.
The paper also gives a nice summary of self-supervised, mainly siamese, approaches.},
  comments         = {Poster From <https://iclr.cc/virtual/2022/poster/6629> The paper itself has a nice summary of recently published self-supervised - mainly siamese - approaches. Claims to be similar to the work in BardesPL2021 which introduced VICReg: Variance-Invariance-Covariance Regularization for Self-Supervised Learning. Contrastive learning has negative examples (''repulsive component'') and this has been thought to help avoid collapse, aka dimensional collapse, aka ``the collapsing problem'' - where the representations learned are constant and trivial (my intuition is that this is like a supervised predictor always predicting the most likely class). SimSiam does not have negative examples and yet does not collapse and it was claimed by the authors that is because it has a stop gradient (not backpropogating the gradient over one encoder) on one side and predictor on the other. Refutes this claim of original SimSiam ChenH2021 paper, first demonstrating that symmetric architectures with and without predictor lead to collapse. Their analysis decomposes the ($l_2$ normalised) representation vector into the centre component (the average/expected value for this vector), as approximated over the mini-batch, and the residual component. Collapse is when all vectors approaches the centre component and the opposite is desirable. They look at the contribution of these two components to the negative gradient when a negative sample is supplied and find that the negative centre component provides de-centring and the negative residual provides de-correlation. Demonstrate that this unifies InfoNCE and SimSiam. Also, from their paper, I learn that an earlier work refuted claim that batch normalisation is essential in BYOL (GrillEtAl2020).},

  comment          = {Describes the reality of ghost work, based on 5 years of study including detailed interviews with ghost workers. Great story telling as well and good consideration of how ghost work fits into the history of employment, especially casual labour, and how it can be much better supported to the benefit of workers and, to an extent, the recipients of their work.

Both the ghost workers and and those who receive their work tend to be treated as customers of the platform, e.g. MTurk that facilitates the work. Most don't allow the workers to be identified by any more than an id code and so job creators have no sense of the person behind the work. Workers can lose out because others get to the job sooner, someone deems their work inadequate or just technology glitches. There is no recourse and no feedback e.g. on how to do the job better another time.

Ghost work fills in technology's last mile - the bit that always requires humans no matter how much technology is advanced. p53. We never seem to replace the need for human effort. p175-6

Uses the Pareto distribution to describe workers - a core small percentage do the vast amount of the work. Whereas an employer would have previously expected all their workers to distribute the workload so that most people are required to perform the bulk of the work, by using ghost work platforms they are starting to use the Pareto distribution for recruitment - avoiding the cost and risks of traditional recruitment. p103-103

Workers don't share a work site, hour or professional identity, which are key ingredients to organising workers interests. p118

Despite this, workers do find ways to collaborate - to reduce costs (signing up, avoiding scams, finding work, and getting paid); to get work done, and; to recreate the social side of work. Ghost work relies on the kindness of strangers. p122 - 123

Chapter 6 addresses how ghost work should be progressed. A few ghost work platforms are aiming at a 'double bottom line' by aiming to make money and have the other goals such as environmental and social benefits. These companies see humans in the loop as assets, a ``commons of talent'' to draw from not a fungible raw material. p141

Some ghost work platforms also use 'scaffolding' to support their workforce - bringing together teams of experienced and novice workers who bring knowledge and new insights into the work mix.

Liken Ghost Work to piecework of the 19th Century 
``It's also true that the long march toward automation has historically created new needs and different types of human labor to fill those needs. In this respect, the new, software-managed work world shares features of the factory jobs that assembled cars by placing workers on a production line where and when they were needed most. It also resembles the so-called piecework that women and children did on farms in the 19th century, assembling matchstick boxes for pennies a pop. And it overlaps in obvious ways with the outsourcing of medical transcription and call center work to the Global South that boomed with the expansion of the internet in the late 1990s.'' p8

``As the Industrial Revolution got under way and machinery began to automate the production of certain goods, such as textiles, the availability of piecework exploded. Piecework (also called “industrial homework,” “putting-out work,” “cottage industry systems,” or “commission systems”) was the part of manufacturing or processing a product done by a person when a machine hit its limits. Piecework jobs were broken down into small, distributable tasks that could be carried out off-site, without stopping production or diverting resources away from the factory floor.7 Assembly lines depended on old divisions of labor. Women and children living at the margins of cities dominated the expendable piecework labor pools.8 In effect, industrial piecework was the first iteration of paid, on-demand ghost work.''},

Local authorities are currently much more interested in compensating the affected households in kind, namely by providing new homes in resettlement sites as a strategy to avoid the creation of new informal settlements. In this context, a resettlement site is an issue of fundamental concern for both the targeted communities and the policy makers. Understanding affected households' preferences regarding resettlement site attributes is crucially important if such relocation projects are to be successful in the long term. This study explores the preferences of affected households for resettlement attributes and compares them to the opinions of professional planning officials. Findings revealed similarities as well as significant differences between the two groups' opinions on what are the important resettlement sites' attributes. The paper further analyses the spatial implications of the two groups' preferences on the suitability of residential areas in the city. Differences in opinions led to different spatial suitability maps of the existing residential areas. Given the substantial spatial implications of the divergent views, selecting a resettlement site based on both stakeholder groups' views would be essential to contribute to more effective and conflict-free resettlement processes.},

Literature shows that most African people have never tested the democratic system being enjoyed, and sometimes taken for granted, by most citizens in many western countries. Using examples from some selected African countries, this article argues that some undemocratic regimes which are characterised by human rights violations managed to get and remain in power because of the support they received and continue to get from some major International Finance Institutions (IFIs) and bilateral donors. It also argues that while these institutions claim to use their financial aid to promote democracy and human rights in their rhetoric, they contradict themselves in practice by failing or cutting aid from local institutions that promote democracy or by supporting undemocratic and authoritarian governments despite overwhelming evidence proving that the governments being supported violates human rights of their citizens. While the author recognises that no country should be left to fend for itself in case of emergency or disaster such as a hurricane or earthquake or genocide, one of the main recommendations of this article is that of making human rights and competitive multi-party democracy a cine qua non-prerequisite for any form of aid. The author believes that doing so will create basic conditions for establishing, and possibly upholding, democratic rule in African countries which refuse to willingly establish democratic rule and respect human rights.},

''Maps, since their conception, are instruments of linguistic imposition, and during this imposition the truth of some is more equal than the truth of others; the perspective of the experts generally being that which determines value. Feminist readings of space seek a wider perspective of a space predicated “man as generic citizen''. The challenge is to find those other views that make up the space, and what are the repercussions and impact they have when they are seen through feminist cartography. ``

On the impacts that these cartographic representations can have, Catherine D'Ignazio, Associate Professor of Urban Science and Planning in the Department of Urban Studies and Planning at MIT and author of the book Data Feminism, states in an interview for this study that:

 ``If you are developing these maps that talk about adequate schools, there is also a role for technology in deepening that inequity and potential gentrification. People are going to take action and make decisions based on these maps. It can further stratify different social spaces. This has to be part of a feminist analysis because the object of research does not end with the production of the map, but has to look at what the map does in the world, the stories about people that the map tells us. We have tremendously segregated cities, so when you produce a map like that, you're also using a proxy to exacerbate racial segregation in society.''

Undertakes qualitative analysis across four dimensions - ethics, feminism, geospatial data and cartography, using literature reviews, interviews with academics, people from the sphere of civil society and feminist activists, and an analysis of existing ethical frameworks (including Locus Charter).

  abstract         = {Biofuels are included in many proposed strategies to reduce anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions and limit the magnitude of global warming. The US Renewable Fuel Standard is the world's largest existing biofuel program, yet despite its prominence, there has been limited empirical assessment of the program's environmental outcomes. Even without considering likely international land use effects, we find that the production of corn-based ethanol in the United States has failed to meet the policy's own greenhouse gas emissions targets and negatively affected water quality, the area of land used for conservation, and other ecosystem processes. Our findings suggest that profound advances in technology and policy are still needed to achieve the intended environmental benefits of biofuel production and use. The Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS) specifies the use of biofuels in the United States and thereby guides nearly half of all global biofuel production, yet outcomes of this keystone climate and environmental regulation remain unclear. Here we combine econometric analyses, land use observations, and biophysical models to estimate the realized effects of the RFS in aggregate and down to the scale of individual agricultural fields across the United States. We find that the RFS increased corn prices by 30\% and the prices of other crops by 20\%, which, in turn, expanded US corn cultivation by 2.8 Mha (8.7\%) and total cropland by 2.1 Mha (2.4\%) in the years following policy enactment (2008 to 2016). These changes increased annual nationwide fertilizer use by 3 to 8\%, increased water quality degradants by 3 to 5\%, and caused enough domestic land use change emissions such that the carbon intensity of corn ethanol produced under the RFS is no less than gasoline and likely at least 24\% higher. These tradeoffs must be weighed alongside the benefits of biofuels as decision-makers consider the future of renewable energy policies and the potential for fuels like corn ethanol to meet climate mitigation goals.},
  comment          = {''Bioenergy is an essential component of most proposed pathways to reduce anthropogenic greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and limit global warming to 1.5 or 2 °C by middle to late century (1-6). Liquid biofuels may contribute to bioenergy's share of climate mitigation by displacing petroleum-based fuels with those generated from modern-day plants (7, 8). The GHG benefits of such substitution, however, are dependent on several factors including'':
- whether biofuel production invokes additional plant growth (9-12), 
- the extent to which combusted plants (typically crops) are replaced in the food system (13-15), 
- the degree to which biofuel production directly and indirectly alters patterns of land use and management (2, 16-20)

''Because land use changes (LUCs) and other consequences induced by biofuels have the potential to cause significant novel GHG emissions and modify other ecosystem services and disservices (21-26), accurately estimating and accounting these outcomes is critical for the formation of effective climate and environmental policy (27-29).''

Studied the Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS) between 2008 to 2016 and found:
- RFS stimulated 20.8 billion L (5.5 Bgal) of additional annual ethanol production, which requires nearly 1.3 billion bushels of corn after accounting for coproducts that can be fed to animals (46)
- heightened demand led to persistent increases in corn prices of ∼31\% (95\% confidence interval [CI]: 5\%, 70\%) compared to BAU
-  increased demand for corn also spilled over onto other crops, increasing soybean prices by 19\% [−8\%, 72\%] and wheat by 20\% [2\%, 60\%]
- increase in corn prices relative to other crops increased the area planted to corn on existing cropland by an average of 2.8 Mha* per year [95\% CI: 2.4, 3.1], which is an 8.7\% increase attributable to the RFS
-  produced a net increase in cropland area of 2.1 Mha [1.8, 2.5] relative to BAU
-  intensity of corn production and extent of cropland caused 7.5\% more reactive nitrogen (N) from synthetic fertilizer to be applied annually to the landscape
-  increased total edge-of-field phosphorus (P) runoff by 3.2\%
- Combined, the RFS-driven changes in cropland area between 2008 and 2016 caused a total net C flux of 397.7 Tg CO2e [313.3, 481.7] to the atmosphere

Cleaning one will cause the clean one to deteriorate. Preserving will have no impact on either. Similar study again with a development slated to go ahead on on a marsh or a forest and participant choose to alow it to go ahead or relocate it to the other. This latter experiment showed a definite action bias - towards moving the development - even through moving it would result in the other resource being damaged.

Two types of imagery: Aerial over USA - National Agriculture Imagery Program (NAIP) and Landsat 8 over Earth

Features used for search initially come from last few layers of pretrained ImageNet ResNet - results good but wanted to improve

Binarise features by injecting noise in training which forces the the weights towards 0 or 1. Than at inference simply threshold at 0.5.

Customise for aerial and satellite data. Training NAIP imagery against OSM classes (as they did for TerraPattern). Great line ``We emphasize that this supervised learning step is not used to produce a network that is good at identifying particular object classes (although it does ultimately do better on these classes), but rather to create a network that produces features that are useful for generic visual search on aerial and satellite imagery'' - sounds like every time we write about Toponet.

For Landsat data used unsupervised approach an autoencoder to compress the 2048 features.

Can use the features for direct search (Hamming distance between query image and others) or hash-based search (a hash of the feature vector).

Future directions look familiar too:
We see three clear future directions for extending the work presented here.
• Multi-scale search - The current system searches at one spatial scale, namely square images that are 128 pixels across. Instead we would like to enable search over a handful of spatial scales, both smaller and larger than 128 pixels across.
• Geospatial filtering - The current system searches across all images that have been indexed, regardless of their geographical location. In the future we would like to enable geospatial filtering, e.g. only return results from Japan.
• Temporal filtering - The current system searches across a single image layer. Although the images within this layer were acquired at different times, that temporal information has not been used in the search. In the future we would like to enable temporal filtering, e.g. only return results that were acquired in May 2018},

Rather than training image encoder and text encoder so that the correct label for the image is predicted, this approach trains the two encoders such that the correct label is paired with the image. At test time, the leaned text encoder synthesizes a zero-shot linear classifier by embedding the names or descriptions of the target dataset's classes.

Contrastive objective is more efficient than label prediction. Also, they find that the resulting models are more flexible and can be turned to fine-grained object classification, geo-localisation, action recognition in videos and OCR. 

CLIP does struggle on more abstract or systemmatic taksks such as prediction how close the nearest car is in an image, and has poor generalisation to images not covered intraining.

the UK Government's commitment to developing a new Digital Strategy, must go far beyond the traditional silo of `digital' and recognise that all aspects of our lives are, and will increasingly be, a hybrid blend of online and offline interactions.

Without urgent Government action we risk:
• services being digitalised, sometime badly, for cost-saving reasons, without understanding the impact on those who use them;
• people feeling (and being) constantly, electronically, monitored at work, working longer and longer hours, unable to switch off or maintain a separation between work and home;
• thousands, maybe millions, of jobs being lost to automation with no plan in place to provide the skills and training needed for those affected to move into the new jobs that will be created; and
• a variety of digital trends and local government funding constraints combining to reduce our opportunities to meet with others. From automated check-out tills, to pub and library closures, homeworking and digital personal trainers, there is a legitimate fear that the digitalisation driven by one pandemic could result in another: a pandemic of loneliness.

The Government should make a careful assessment of the climate change implications of the hybrid world and adopt policies to mitigate any negative impact.

Addressses with details and potential solutions:
• Digital inequality; e.g. “11\% of households do not have internet access”
• Skills and training; Digital Skills Gap
• Data and research; ``unless we have a robust evidence base to help us understand the impact of digitalisation on different communities, and the effectiveness of different digital services and interventions, we will not be able to make the most of the digital future''
• Co-operation; Working in collaboration ``Communities have a wealth of knowledge about what will work best for their members, and it is by listening to their views and experiences that we can ensure that interventions will have the biggest, and best, impact.''
• Resilience; regulation and rights; ``any threat to digital infrastructure will threaten our ability to work, access essential services, buy groceries online, and access our money through online banking''
• Online harms. ``there is an urgent need for comprehensive research to explore the relationship between digital technology and wellbeing, particularly amongst children and young people. This research must go beyond screen time alone, and must also consider the experiences of marginalised and vulnerable young people.''

Also looks at specific issues when digitalising health, education in schools, work (including gig economy), social interaction

Paper from Google

Train network to learn the id of documents (intuition: document id not document class - as many classes as documents). A sequence to sequence task

Don't train with the whole document, but take e.g. the first L tokens, or a randomly sample contiguous set of tokens, or de-duplicated set, or... (the first seems to work best, I think)

id is output as a string

Try generating semantically structured identifiers so that similar documents have similar ids. This is achieved using ?BERT and do hierarchical embeddings to cluster. Don't seem happy with these and suggest looking at alternatives.

Works better with smaller data sets.
Works better with larger models.
Works better for shorter tokenisation of documents (similar to dataset size).
Compare to BM25 which is standard for search

Weights are differentiable so it can be incorporated into another neural model, e.g. in reinforcement learning when an agent needs to store data for later retreival.

Yet there are ample reasons to suspect that climate change could result in a global catastrophe. Analyzing the mechanisms for these extreme consequences could help galvanize action, improve resilience, and inform policy, including emergency responses. We outline current knowledge about the likelihood of extreme climate change, discuss why understanding bad-to-worst cases is vital, articulate reasons for concern about catastrophic outcomes, define key terms, and put forward a research agenda. The proposed agenda covers four main questions: 1) What is the potential for climate change to drive mass extinction events? 2) What are the mechanisms that could result in human mass mortality and morbidity? 3) What are human societies' vulnerabilities to climate-triggered risk cascades, such as from conflict, political instability, and systemic financial risk? 4) How can these multiple strands of evidence—together with other global dangers—be usefully synthesized into an “integrated catastrophe assessment”? It is time for the scientific community to grapple with the challenge of better understanding catastrophic climate change.},

One way to do this is to forgo ownership of certain consumer goods, such as cars. Although proponents of sufficiency claim that car shedding (i.e., giving away a vehicle so that the household no longer has its own car) might increase subjective well-being (SWB), there is little empirical evidence supporting this. This paper aims to help fill this gap by adding empirical evidence on the relationship between car shedding and SWB. Data from the Swiss Household Panel is used (2006-2017) with a fixed-effects model assessing the year-to-year changes in evaluative and affective well-being (life satisfaction, leisure satisfaction, joy, and anger) before and after car shedding. Separate analyses for non-affordability-driven and affordability-driven car shedders were conducted. Results show that non-affordability-driven car shedding has a positive effect on feelings of joy one to three years after the event. Affordability-driven car shedding, in contrast, is associated with a decrease in leisure satisfaction and feelings of joy up to three years later. Levels of positive affective wellbeing already decrease in anticipation of affordability-driven car shedding. A sufficiency measure like non-affordability-driven car shedding is not associated with reducing SWB, and this may have policy implications.},

This paper finds that an average of the weights across the hyperparamters is almost as good as the ensemble and doesn't require as much memory. Averaging can can be as a single hit or it can be 'greedy'. The latter averages the master weights with a new model's weights and retains this average as the master model if the validation accuracy improves (discards it overwise).

Background
Human impacts on earth-system processes are overshooting several planetary boundaries, driving a crisis of ecological breakdown. This crisis is being caused in large part by global resource extraction, which has increased dramatically over the past half century. We propose a novel method for quantifying national responsibility for ecological breakdown by assessing nations' cumulative material use in excess of equitable and sustainable boundaries.
Methods
For this analysis, we derived national fair shares of a sustainable resource corridor. These fair shares were then subtracted from countries' actual resource use to determine the extent to which each country has overshot its fair share over the period 1970-2017. Through this approach, each country's share of responsibility for global excess resource use was calculated.
Findings
High-income nations are responsible for 74\% of global excess material use, driven primarily by the USA (27\%) and the EU-28 high-income countries (25\%). China is responsible for 15\% of global excess material use, and the rest of the Global South (ie, the low-income and middle-income countries of Latin America and the Caribbean, Africa, the Middle East, and Asia) is responsible for only 8\%. Overshoot in higher-income nations is driven disproportionately by the use of abiotic materials, whereas in lower-income nations it is driven disproportionately by the use of biomass.
Interpretation
These results show that high-income nations are the primary drivers of global ecological breakdown and they need to urgently reduce their resource use to fair and sustainable levels. Achieving sufficient reductions will likely require high-income nations to adopt transformative post-growth and degrowth approaches.

The analysis reveals how the emerging field of SPIS drew upon a growing range of disciplines in the late 1950s and 1960s, and how the relationship with these disciplines evolved over time. Around the mid-1980s, substantial parts of SPIS started to coalesce into a more coherent field centred on the adoption of an evolutionary (or neo-Schumpeterian) economics framework, an interactive model of the innovation process, and (a little later) the concept of `systems of innovation' and the resource-based view of the firm.

Should return to for very short summaries of key papers, developments and authors in the field. 

Idea of ``science push'' linear model of innovation which arose from Vannevar Bush's influential [1945] science policy report to the US Government entitled Science the Endless Frontier.

Schmookler 1966 ``Invention and economics growth is credited with the demand-pull model'' of innovation.

''Kline and Rosenberg [1986] ... effectively ended the `science-push' versus `demand-pull' debate ... argued that one needed to move beyond simple linear models and instead put forward an interactive `chain-linked' model of the innovation process''

Nelson and Arrow on economics of research.

''Knowledge industry'' including patents and much more from Machlup which became known as knowledge economy.

Heller and eisenburg [1998] Patents can give rise to 'anti-commons' because they deter innovation.

Vernon 1966 Product-cycle theory of trade, four stage model of the product cycle in which new goods are developed in industrialised countries and spread to developing countries.

Organisational learning, learning organisation, intelligent enterprise - ideas developed around firms that are able to develop and apply innovations.

Organisational psychology has contributed work around stimulation of the productivity of researchers ``autonomy, interaction with colleagues, the balance between pure and applied research, and some degree of tension between personal and organisational goals''.

''early 1980s witnessed the emergence of what has gradually become for many a common conceptual framework based around evolutionary economics, the interactive model of the innovation process, and, a little later, the notion of `systems of innovation' and the resource-based view of the firm''

''Kanter [1983], ... demonstrated how overly `segmentalist' management could create barriers to innovation, contrasting this with a more integrative style of management which is likely to result in productivity improvement and innovation''.

''Drucker [1985] focused on Innovation and Entrepreneurship, arguing that entrepreneurship is not a specialist talent of a few gifted individuals but is pervasive in a healthy society, not just in the private sector but also in public service organisations. He also warned against infatuation with new technology-based innovation to the detriment of often more important social innovations''. Later (1993) ``argued that we are witnessing the emergence of `post-capitalist society', in which the primary resource for creating wealth is knowledge''.

''Piore and Sabel {1984}, who argued that capitalism had reached a turning-point, where it has to choose between two alternatives - to continue along the existing trajectory of mass-production technology (the course chosen at the first `industrial divide'), or to switch towards craft-based production and exploiting computer technology to make possible `flexible specialisation', thus creating an environment in which firms compete on the basis of innovations but cooperate with regard to developing the necessary technological knowledge and skills.''

''resource-based view of the firm as an alternative to the transaction-cost theory of the firm''. ```in-house knowledge of technology' as one of a firm's key resources''

Related to systems of innovation: Etzkowitz and Leydesdorff 2000 triple helix: universities, industry and government. Universities were initially for teaching, then `first academic revolution' they took on the function of research in the 19th Century, now 'second academic revolution' when taking on `third mission' of contributing to the economy and society. [izz: each revolution has downplayed the importance of those earlier roles].

Gibbons et al [1994] knowledge production can be Mode 1 - universal theories, basic research - and Mode 2 - applications. [Iz: debate about which came first, in fact]

Some of this has come out of particular institutions, e.g. SPRU (and Project SAPPHO), PREST at Manchester University, Centre for Policy Alternatives at MIT, Harvard. The list of highly cited publications is heavily dominated by US-based authors although this papers suggests a range of reason why they may be.

  abstract         = {{With the field of innovation studies (IS) now half a century old, the occasion has been marked by several studies looking back to identify the main advances made over its lifetime. Starting from a list of 20 advances over the field's history, this discussion paper sets out 20 challenges for coming decades. The intention is to prompt a debate within the IS community on what are, or should be, the key challenges, and more generally on what sort of field we aspire to be. It is argued that the empirical focus of our studies has failed to keep pace with the fast changing world, especially the shift from manufacturing to services and the increasingly urgent need for sustainability. The way we conceptualise, define, operationalise and analyse `innovation' seems somewhat rooted in the past, leaving us less able to grapple with other less visible or `dark' forms of innovation.}},
  comment          = {What was science policy and innovation studies (SPIS) is possibly now just innovation studies (IS). 

this papers looks at what IS should be doing, such as considering the direction of innovation and not just assuming that all innovation and good.



Twenty challenges for innovation studies

1 	From visible innovation to `dark innovation' 
Innovation may not just be technology and manufacturing, other innovation exists but this is perhaps hidden or 'dark'. explains this with imprinting theory - that institutions have values and norms based on their formation and so technology and manufacturing would have been the focus for IS several decades ago. this focus is probably also reflected in the measures of innovation activity. 

Schumpeter had a broader perspective on innovation,  whilst still using manufacturing temrs he was not restricted to product or process innovations.

Other innovations may be in organisations, incremental process innovations in factories, services, social (social media), grassroots. Also 'salami publishing' cutting a piece of work into smaller parts to publish separately. Self- plagarism or worse not referencing the other works.

2 	From innovation in manufacturing to innovation in services 

3 	From `boy's toys' to the liberation of `housewives' 
Interesting table, reflects interests of researchers rather than breadth of innovation?

4 	From national and regional to global systems of innovation 
The challenge to IS researchers is to identify, map and analyse these global systems of innovation and their interactions with national and regional systems ( Lundvall 2007 ; Soete et al. 2010 )

5 	From innovation for economic productivity to innovation for sustainability (`green innovation') 
''… innovation is a vector, rather than just a scalar quantity. ( Stirling 2008 : 263)''
''The 1990s saw increasing concern with environmental damage, the using up of scarce resources, and global warming. ... was regarded as rather `flaky' by some in IS, although it is now having a significant impact (e.g. Geels 2002 )''

6 	From innovation for economic growth to innovation for sustainable development (from Lundvall)
The challenge for IS scholars is to respond to the pressing world need for more equitable development, working with others on development studies and sustainability

7 	From risky innovation to socially responsible innovation 
''damage to the environment, less desirable working conditions or other adverse effects on the quality of life'' - questions whether the risk is higher or if awareness is greater and argues for more participatory approaches to decision-making, constructive technology assessment, consensus conferences or citizens juries

8 	From innovation for wealth creation to innovation for wellbeing (or from `more is better' to `enough is enough') 
Shift the focus from m-wealth to r-wealth

9 	From `winner take all' to `fairness for all'? 
''as innovation has become more collective and `open', the rewards have become increasingly individualised'' Mazzucato etc 
''wider belief that extreme wealth for a few individuals is a necessary facet of free-market capitalism''
Questions whether IS should be passive and just observe or in fact have a duty to explore how greater fairness could be achieved.

10 	From government as fixer of failures to the entrepreneurial state 
From Mazzucato
Many Nobel prizes to those who've claimed to prove that gov intervention causes innefficiencies. Much like innovation, maybe innovation policy need to be more experimental.

11 	From faith-based policy (and policy-based evidence) to evidence-based policy?
from Steinmueller
Policy makers tend to be politically wedded to a particular policy and don't draw on evidence . Difficult to build evidence as double-blind policy trials are difficult/impossible.
 
12 	Balancing the intrinsic tensions between intellectual property and open source 
highlights difference between pharmaceuticals in which patenting is apparently a big incentive to innovation, whereas in open sourcing software seems to be an incentive

13 	Balancing the intrinsic tensions between exploration and exploitation 
some organisations do both well, others do one or the other, what conditions are required for each?

14 	Balancing the intrinsic tensions between closed and open innovation 
Absortive capacity of organisation to take in innovation and new ideas. Open innovation has been used as a reason to remove R\&D capacity (someone else will do it) - but this couuld reduce absorptive capacity.

15 	Balancing the intrinsic tensions between competition and cooperation 

16 	Pricking academic bubbles 
Even academics have a tendancy to follow trends and also competition for scarce funding can encourage the raising of expectations. Also may be danger of being uncritical of Schumpeter (Iz: and Mazzucato?)? 

17 	Identifying the causes of the current economic crisis 
''Financial innovations such as sub-prime mortgages, collateralised debt obligations and credit default swaps all played a central role in creating the crisis, giving rise to a process of `destructive creation' ( Soete 2013 ).'' ``Here, it is not so much that IS researchers contributed to these financial innovations. Rather, it is that we almost completely failed to provide any analysis and understanding of them, or to offer any warnings'' (except Nightingale et al''

18 	Avoiding disciplinary sclerosis 
Intellectual in-breeding, less adventurous, more theory-driven less policy-driven, 

19 	Helping to generate a new paradigm for economics: from Ptolemaic economics to??? 
''Like Dosi (2011) , I sense that economics today is eerily reminiscent of Ptolemaic astronomy with its complicated epicycles'' ``If there is to be any chance of success, the IS community will need to join forces with newer and more sympathetic subfields of economics such as behavioural economics, experimental economics and ecological economics''

20 	Maintaining our research integrity, sense of morality and collegiality
self-policing in other areas (parliament, journalism, ...) has been shown to be ineffective. When there's competition for resources, signs of integrity and social capital eroding.

This paper looks at (supervised) training of ViTs more efficiently and identifies some methods (using ImageNet, so not sure how applicable it would be to RS data for instance). 
	
Pre-training with lower resolution images is faster and can result in better classification outcomes
	
Training examples also had random cropping - a square that likely to retain the image's subject taken from the low res image (this was enough because they had squillions of images)
	
By using very strong colour transforms of the data and believe this encouraged the ViT, which is apparently less sensitive to object outlines than CNNs, to focus more on shapes
	
Stochastic depth regularisation skipped layers randomly and so forced individuals layers to play a greater role
	
LayerScale uses learnable scaling parameter for the layers which effectively allows the network to accumulate more layers as it learns},

These include techniques from service design research that focuses on user experience and co-creation practice; and strands of evolutionary economics that focus on shifting and shaping technology and innovation frontiers and managing complex systems under conditions of uncertainty.''

Nice description of market-fixing reasoning and goes on to explain how this ``dominant analytical framework and its tool is not fit for purpose'' (because major challenges cannot be reduced to 'externalities' or 'public goods'.

Growth has a direction as well as a rate (see also Entrepreneurial state or Mission Economy?)

Regarding innovation 'top-down' can stifle innovation while 'bottom up' ``can make it dispersieve with little impact''.

How can public value be understood - small discussion of participatory evaluation, opinion polls. stakeholder workshops, citizen's juries. Others have tried to determine a monetary value e.g. contingent valuation.

How Government Digital Service was so successful - Mike Bracken threw out efficiency targets and brought in user-focussed KPIs.

The public value of the BBC is not just the niche aspects that other broadcasters would not produce, but also the more commercial offerings - rather than crowding out other broadcasters but supports innovation in these areas and also thus reaches a wider audience with all its output

Constraining state budgets so that spending is balanced by tax etc. neglects the important aspect of state spending that encourages growth

Discussion of the weaknesses of cost-benefit analysis, even social cost-benefit analysis, which are very short term in their outlook because they compare to status quo

Go on to suggest frameworks and principles applied to policy evaluation, such as systems thinking and systems dynamics which are more appropriate for complex, dynamic systems.

Core characteristics of complex systems:
- Hetergeneous agents
- Fundamental uncertainty
- Path dependence
- Disproportionality of cause and effect
- Emergence
- Absence of optimatlity

Real-time data, progress against milestones, measreus of cross-sectoral and cross-science impact, 

accept tension between top-down and bottom-up!

Deleidi studies demonstrated a larger multiplier affect with mission-oriented innovation

''Dynamic efficiency involves making the best use of resources
to achieve changes over time and so is concerned with innovation, investment, improvement and growth - including, perhaps most importantly, the creation of new resources (technologies) and shifting technology frontiers (Huerta de Soto 2009).''},

I've read only the preface and prologue. I understand from these that the book is founded on a ``vicious syllogism'' with the four premises and conclusion:
1. if we don't keep below 2.0 degrees, we're in for dangerous, unpredictable, potentially catastrophic climate change
2. If we don't limit global emissions to 1,300 bn tonnes CO2e, we shall not stay below 2.0 degrees
3. If we haven't already minimally embarked on limiting emissions we will not limit them to 1,300 bn tonnes
4. We have not now even minimally embarked on such a programme
- Conclusion: We are in for dangerous, unpredictable and potentially catastrophic climate change

Each COP seems to be a ``last chance'' - global alarm clock on snooze - we are still not admitting that destructive climate change is coming. He makes the point is that denial is also something that ``the good guys''.

Starting with data containing (legitimate) imbalance in both underlying sample (some things are just more represented than others in the world - although I'm not convinced the example given is a fair illustration of this) and labels, 4 further datasets are created:
1. no sampling or label bias
2. sampling bias but no label bias
3. no sampling bias, but label bias
4. both sampling and label
However, two versions of each are created:
Experiment A - the sample and label imbalance is completely removed
Experiment B - the data balance is unmodified from the original dataset

Trained elastic net logistic classier

With each set of predictions, tested 6 metrics:
- Difference in Means
- Difference in Residuals
- Equal Opportunity
- Equal Mis-opportunity
- Disparate Impact
- Normalized Mutual Information

Metrics were not very good at differentiating between bias and legitimate imbalances in the data

Metrics were more sensitive to sample than label bias

There is no established threshold to most fairness metrics and response is dataset-dependent and so comparison of metrics should be compared against a known unbiased result

In 1841, Friedrich List, motivated to determine how Germany could overtake England in industrial development, identified that more than ``material'' capital was required. He cited ``mental'' or intellectual capital as important.  ``Germany developed one of the best technical educational and training systems in the world …  overtaking Britain in the latter half of the 19th century'' 

The system of Innovation includes education, including non-teaching such as museums and events and government assistance and direction, etc

In the late 19th century Germany industries innovated by introducing the in-house R\&D department. In-house R\&D became more prevalent after the second World war. The dominant idea of innovation was science and technology push - The Linear Model - with R\&D being seen as the source of innovation. In the 50s and 60s, however, evidence that diffusion of innovation was more important to economic growth and being the first in the world with the radical innovations. Also social innovations we're as important as technical innovations.

In the 80s and 90s it became evident that incremental Innovations came from areas other than R\&D such as production engineers technicians and from interactions with the market.

Comparing Japan with the USSR whilst both invested a similar amount in in R\&D in the 60s and the USSR invested more in the 80s. Japan made greater gains in industry. Much of their investment was in civil research. They had greater social, technical and economic linkages in their system than the USSR, where incentives for higher productivity were low. Similarly comparing South Korea (and possibly South Asian countries) with Brazil (and possibly South American countries), aspects that led to greater growth in SK appear to be greater education as well as investment in R\&D, but also more automation and better use of communication technologies.

With globalisation there has been debate over whether increasing standardisation of products and processes has occurred, indeed whether we should be talking about an interlinked economy or ILE transnational and multinational corporations. However the evidence remains that not only is R\&D in multinational organisations still very much focused in the original country but also that due to uncertainty, localised learning and bounded rationality, there may be increasing diversity of products. ``Neoclassical assumptions [about] perfect information are at the border lines of credibility and usefulness''. In terms of diffusion of innovations whilst incremental Innovations may easily diffuse over borders radical Innovations would require changes in production capability and social and institutional frameworks and so national systems of innovation become an extremely important concept.

Questions posed, not necesarily answered are around:
what are public values, to whom do they apply and how does private enterprise relate to them?
can public value be assessed (I guess measured?)
what are the relationships between public values, how to they fit together, conflict, is there a hierarchy or are some contained by others?

Based on review of ``leading (largest circulation) public administration periodicals in the United States, the United Kingdom, and Scandinavian countries and studies chiefly published during the period 1990-2003'' and claim these ``represent very different positions on the spectrum of the welfare state and, perhaps, different views about public values''

Result is 72 registered values, grouped into 6 ``constelations''. Values associated with:
 - the Public Sector's Contribution to Society
   - Common good
     - Public interest
     - Social cohesion
   - Altruism
     - Human dignity
   - Sustainability
     - Voice of the future
   - Regime dignity
     - Regime stability
 - Transformation of Interests to Decisions

   - User democracy

     - Protection of individual rights
 - the Relationship Between the Public Administration and Politicians
   - Political loyalty
     - Accountability
     - Responsiveness
 - the Relationship Between Public Administration and Its Environment
   - Openness-secrecy

     - Citizen involvement
     - Citizen's self-development
   - User orientation
     - Timeliness
     - Friendliness

Also consider the proximity of values and identify some nodal values, that seem to be related to many other values (human dignity, sustainability, citizen involvement, openness, secrecy, compromise, integrity and robustness). Other prime values, which are valued for themselves, and instrumental values, which enable other values to be achieved.

Conclusion
 - Public Value Is Not Governmental
 - Many Public Values Are Prime Values But Cannot Be Distinguished on That Basis Alone
 - Public Values Analysis Is Both Causal Inquiry (Instrumental Values) and Philosophical and Moral Inquiry (Prime Values)
 - Values Relationships Are Many and Unwieldy But Must Be Sorted Out},

  abstract         = {The purpose of the paper is to describe and explain sectoral patterns of technical change as revealed by data on about 2000 significant innovations in Britain since 1945. Most technological knowledge turns out not to be “information” that is generally applicable and easily reproducible, but specific to firms and applications, cumulative in development and varied amongst sectors in source and direction. Innovating firms principally in electronics and chemicals, are relatively big, and they develop innovations over a wide range of specific product groups within their principal sector, but relatively few outside. Firms principally in mechanical and instrument engineering are relatively small and specialised, and they exist in symbiosis with large firms, in scale intensive sectors like metal manufacture and vehicles, who make a significant contribution to their own process technology. In textile firms, on the other hand. most process innovations come from suppliers. These characteristics and variations can be classified in a three part taxonomy based on firms: (1) supplier dominated; (2) production intensive; (3) science based. They can be explained by sources of technology, requirements of users, and possibilities for appropriation. This explanation has implications for our understanding of the sources and directions of technical change, firms' diversification behaviour, the dynamic relationship between technology and industrial structure, and the formation of technological skills and advantages at the level of the firm. the region and the country.},
  comment          = {Using database of innovations that are labelled according to their sector, this paper makes a number of observations and theories about the nature of innovation in Britain, accepting that the database does not contain a complete view [Iz: it doesn't contain knowledge/data industries and innovation].

Because the data are not complete, don't attempt to make statistical inference but do cross reference with statistical analysis for US by Scherer (1982)

Consider questions like “science and technology push versus demand pull” (see also Scherer and Schmookler refs), whether product or process innovations dominate, and the importance of organisation size.

In general, they find that it is very hard to make generalisations across sectors.

Organisations are grouped into categories:
- Science-based firms (much R\&D, drawing on other's R\&D, e.g. chemical and electronic sectors; innovation develops basic science and engineering)
- Supplier-dominated firms (small with weak in-house R\&D and engineering, e.g. manufacturing, agriculture, housebuilding; innovation is cuts costs)
- Scale/production-intensive firms (pin factories!; innovation increases productivity)
- Specialised equipment suppliers (supply equipment and knowledge)

Considers the sector of
- The source of the technology used
- The source and nature of the technology produced
- The characteristics of the innovating firm

And thus create a taxonomy of innovations has 5 possible combinations between a), b), and c) all being the same and them all being different

Most knowledge comes from within the same sector

Product innovations == improvement in performance of capital goods == innovation used outside of the sector

Process innovations == cheapening of capital goods == innovations used inside the sector},

Taxes and charges can be based on absolute pollution, which is more straighforward. However, this could lead to costs that disproportionately impact the poorest (although inequality can/should also be addressed)

One of the fundamental ideas in this book is that the increase of consumption leads to a requirement for more administration and management of good consumed. With the demise of servant roles, there is a rise in the ``crypto-servent house-wife''. The housewife, as with the entrepreneur and small business owner working for more than they are paid, are all receiving compensation in the form of ``convenient social virtue''.

Propose an alternative approach to policy evaluation based on public value as collectively understood by stakeholders that include the market, the state and civil society based on literature review for five years up to 201, review of policy cases and the outcomes of a workshop in 2019. 

Key conclusions:
- Diverse range of appraisal and evaluation practices as well as real-time monitoring (e.g. dashboards) that challenge traditional approaches
- Policy evaluation includes retrospective reviews alongside prospective methods
- Reflexive capabilities that cover various public frames such as economic, legal and organisational dimensions
- Identified 80 different policy evaluation and appraisal methodologies from cost-benefit analysis to social fabric matrices, asset mapping and public value mapping
- 35\% of literature referred to market-fixing, 46\% to market-shaping and 24\% to non-market-oriented frameworks
- Alternative evaluation methods are being taken seriously by the academic and specialist community
- Market fixing frameworks are heavily reliant on quantitative models whereas market-shaping analytical methods are more diverse, e.g. agent-based modelling and living labs
- Policy-makers are using alternative tools far less 
Recommendations
- Include alternative approaches in UK's Green Book and Magenta Book
- Integrate alternative tools to existing appraisal methodologies 
- Policy appraisal and evaluations need to motivate ambitious outcomes and capture the changing policy environment
- Regulation frameworks also need reflect public value and market-shaping
- A community of practise and analysis and testing of ways in which mainstream and alternative appraisal and evaluation tools can be brought together},

  comment          = {Say that the state provides a framework for law and order, enforcement of contacts and other institutions underpinning the market, yet constrained so as not to interfere with property rights. State also important for incentive frameworks of investment, enterprise and development. This paper considers development more broadly than others. Probably the discussion is more nuanced than I am currently able to detect and there's a lot about property rights that I simply don't understand as it seems to be essential to ``growth''.

Discussion of what is a strong state. This requires political centralisation (as opposed to local jurisdictions) and willingness to make commitments (despite diverse interest groups). There is a very long discussion of capacity.

There needs to be limits to government to prevent capture by special interest groups.

The state must be pluralistic to represent diverse groups.

Note the possible conflict between centralisation and pluralism. England had apparently historically managed to balance these. 

Contrast collectivist (e.g. East Asian) with individualist societies, the former helping the state's capacity more.

Goes on to discuss political decentralisation which enables greater local accountability, but had higher risk of capture. Notes that more mobile societies are less prone as electorate more aware.

Another problem with decentralisation is the devolution of responsibility without the corresponding funds - unfunded mandates.

Democracy is slow but if it has legitimacy is stabilising and curbs excesses of capitalism. There are plenty of examples of powerful interests undermining accountability processes and politicians dispensing benefits for votes.

Apparently, voting behaviour is significantly influenced more by recurring benefits arranged by local governments than by even large one-time benefits.

''A recent review suggest that strategies towards ​efficiency have to be complemented by those pushing ​sufficiency (Parrique et al 2019), that is, `the dir​ect downscaling of economic production in many ​sectors and parallel reduction of consumption' ​(p 3). Although concrete political strategies towards ​sufficiency—or degrowth—are still fragmented and ​diverse, they may include restrictive supply-side ​policy instruments targeting fossil fuels (instead of ​relative efficiency improvements), redistribution (of ​work and leisure, natural resources and wealth), ​a decentralization of the economy or new social ​security institutions (that complement the growth​ oriented welfare state). Recently suggested policies ​include moratoria on resource extraction and new ​infrastructures (e.g. coal power plants, highways, air​ports), bans on harmful activities (e.g. fracking, coal ​mining), the reduction of working hours and redis​tributive taxation, instead of just putting a price on ​resources and emissions (Schneider et al 2010, Kallis ​2011, Koch 2013, Sekulova et al 2013, Jackson 2016, ​Green and Denniss 2018, Hickel and Kallis 2019). A ​new study suggests, however, that even energy suffi​ciency actions may be associated with rebound effects ​and negative spillovers (Sorrell et al 2020).''

Find very little evidence of absolute decoupling, and these only for short period. Some evidence of relative decoupling. Mainly decoupling is due to efficiency and so little decoupling from energy used. No evidence that current rates are enough to reach climate goals. Also, decoupling was for production not consumption. Some evidence of reducing in material resource use or ``dematerialisation''. 

Grouped studies as having either ``green growth'' or ``degrowth'' agenda, it other. Very little in degrowth. Still most studies valued growth, some implicitly more than environmental goals.

Evidence that causality between GDP and resource in both directions. Past material and energy use is also relevant.

No novel policy recommendations in those papers that gave any. Rarely demand side policy to reduce consumption.

Suggest that sufficiency as well as efficiency is vital to meet climate goals and using measures of well-being better than GDP.

  comment          = {Early discussion of machine p7 (bottom)

The labour share of income in G7 countries has fallen for decades p9

The automation theory argument is that technical change has reduced the demand for labour p11

This book argues that 1. The decrease in labour is not due to technical change but economic stagnation; 2. This manifests as under employment; 3. Inequality will not be addressed because elites accept/welcome low pay of workers; and 4. Abundance is possible without full or hourly full automation

De-industrialisation is due to over-capacity and global competition p24-5

Depressed prices resulted in reduced profits and lower investment and thus lower productivity improvements. The only way to stay afloat is taking market share from others (and buying back shares). Increased robotisation maintains competitiveness and, in fact, jobs because these companies/countries remain in operation p26


Manufacturing has been a unique driver of growth p34

Workers are leaving the manufacturing pool into service jobs which are low productivity p35

Instead of capital investment, companies are buying back their own shares (financialisation) p35

Services are also mostly non-tradeable so no use for international market therefore developing countries try to expand into manufacturing p37

So it's no technical dynamism but increasing stagnation 

The gap between productivity and output growth determines the demand for labour. The automation discourse says that jobs are being lost to automation (productivity) but this book argues that we have overcapacity and so demand relative to output is falling. P39

Major destroyer of livelihoods in the 20th century was not “silicon capitalism” but nitrogen capitalism - the green revolution p42

With increasing unemployment in 70s and 80s, and beyond, Governments changed welfare payments form short-term support to an inducement to work (by reducing their value) p47

Because there are fewer jobs and welfare is lower, people accept decreasing pay and conditions p47-8

Originally, job protection was for those job taken by the `main breadwinner'. Other jobs were less important and so were less protected. Now families relying on these unprotected roles for their main/sole income p50

Keynesian stimulation was attempted as divestment increased from 70s. But this counter-cyclical investment didn't stimulate high economic growth, private investment was not encouraged despite low interest rates p66-8

Keynes said that such conditions “economic maturity” require the shrinking of labour supply, e.g. a reduction in working week rather than in increase in the labour demand p69

This was also Beveridge's 1944 plan, but it wasn't enacted

Due to competition, people should by the cheapest product. If productivity cannot be improved then wages have to decrease to retain a competitive position p60

OECD was formed to increase labour flexibility i.e. reduce labour protections p61

“Automation is lot like global warming: when people take it seriously, they find themselves willing to consider revisions to the basic structure of social life that they otherwise would have thought impossible” p65

Large asset owners will lose power as the state invests. They therefore threaten “capital strike” to prevent state investment, thus “radical Keysianism”. Beveridge was defeated by the capitalists p70-1

There's a discussion of UBI, by both left- and right-wing versions p72-9

UBI does not separate income from assets - large asset owners retain the power p78 and control over investment decisions p79

Argue that the post-scarcity world and the steps needed to get there need to be imagined  - automation may not free us from work p82

Historic discussions of post-scarcity: The ancient Greeks distinguished the free world (citizens) from the necessary world (slaves). Thomas More divided a person's life into these realms - emancipating servant and this influence Marx and others p83-6

“Once necessity is assured, everyone is free to develop their individuality outside the bounds of any given community” p90

“The first thing people would actually do in a post-scarcity world … work to mitigate or reverse climate change and to make up for the centuries of inequality that followed colonialism” p92-3

“Economic growth never frees us from the need to grow more” p93},

''The difference between the ecological and neoclassical perspectives leads to different policy-making objectives. Daly (1992) defines three policy objectives for ecological economics, which have been widely applied in this research field (e.g. Deepak, 2010; Lawn, 2001; Stewen, 1998). The objectives are, in order of relative importance: (1) sustainable scale of resource use, (2) fair distribution of income and wealth, and (3) efficient allocation of resources''

Grouped degrowth topics into 3 broad goals:
1. Reduce the environmental impact of human activities
2. Redistribute income and wealth both within and between countries
3. Promote the transition from a materialistic to a convivial and participatory society

As well as identifying the ecological economics policy objectives addressed, they considered whether proposal where local, national or international and whether they were top-down or bottom up

Most proposal had a national focus and were top-down in approach, indicating that state has a large role to play despite the dominant narrative of transformation from grassroots. 

Also, literature is more focused on social equity than environmental sustainability.

Studies show some positive impacts on consumer choice but not always

Key challenges
- Labelling needs to also be understood as valuable for its impact on the producer
- High carbon emitters may be resistent to labelling and lead to weaking of schemes
- Labelling schemes are not panaceas and will not reduce emissions on their own
- Quantification needs to be accurate, this require transparency and can also aid more wider attempts to detect greenwashing. Economy-wide labelling would enable better understanding of emissions for border adjustment on other instruments},

  comment          = {Using our complexity science lens, we isolate 9 categories of interventions to accelerate action, as follows. 

First, public engagement on climate could be stronger. As recently as March 2020, 61\% of the British public were either completely unaware of the concept of “net zero emissions” (42\%) or had heard `hardly anything about it' (19\%) (BEIS, 2020b). These figures are improving, however. By September 2020, 53\% had heard nothing (30\%) or hardly anything (23\%) about net zero. The announcement of the Prime Minister's “Ten Point Plan” in November 2020 has also presumably increased awareness. Deeper public engagement with the changes ahead is necessary (see section 3.1). 

Second, the transition, while net positive, will create winners and losers. The losers should know that they will be supported through the transition to ensure social justice (section 3.2). Without such support, progress could falter or stop completely. 

Third, the institutions of government are not geared up for such a mammoth effort. Political leadership can come and go, bold decisions can be shied away from, and trade-offs made where achieving net zero is not the top priority. A reorganisation of government is required (section 3.3). 

Fourth, some of largest polluters do not face the biggest penalties. Following the polluter pays principle, we recommend continued efforts on carbon pricing, the removal of fossil subsidies, and a `carbon takeback obligation' requiring firms who extract or import fossil fuels to put an increasing proportion of the carbon back in the ground (section 3.4). 

Fifth, the UK has a role in leveraging global dynamics (section 3.5) in the transition, particularly as host of COP 26. This means embracing the fact that the UK can affect emissions beyond its borders, and that action can and should be taken to complement domestic measures. 

Sixth, we note the role of business in embracing net-zero and suggest how to build on growing business climate ambition (section 3.6). 

Seventh, ongoing global technological advances are occurring, and we suggest opportunities for the UK to intervene, where appropriate, to accelerate technological trends, for the UK's, and the world's benefit (section 3.7). 

Eighth, we acknowledge the work being done to align the UK's business and financial systems to the world's climate objectives and suggest Paris-aligned accounts as a simple way to accelerate this (section 3.8). 

Ninth, but not least, we note how incremental changes to the UK's legal frameworks can help unlock faster progress (section 3.9).},

This book contains the most sustained and serious attack on mainstream, neoclassical economics in more than forty years.

Richard R. Nelson and Sidney G. Winter focus their critique on the basic question of how firms and industries change overtime.

They marshal significant objections to the fundamental neoclassical assumptions of profit maximization and market equilibrium, which they find ineffective in the analysis of technological innovation and the dynamics of competition among firms. To replace these assumptions, they borrow from biology the concept of natural selection to construct a precise and detailed evolutionary theory of business behavior.

They grant that firms are motivated by profit and engage in search for ways of improving profits, but they do not consider them to be profit maximizing.

Likewise, they emphasize the tendency for the more profitable firms to drive the less profitable ones out of business, but they do not focus their analysis on hypothetical states of industry equilibrium. The results of their new paradigm and analytical framework are impressive.

Not only have they been able to develop more coherent and powerful models of competitive firm dynamics under conditions of growth and technological change, but their approach is compatible with findings in psychology and other social sciences.

Finally, their work has important implications for welfare economics and for government policy toward industry.

prevents the economist from understanding the microeconomic sources of productivity growth in the economy. It is organisations—including household families, business enterprises and government agencies—and not markets that invest in the productive capabilities embodied in physical and human capital that generate productivity.''

''In sum, the theory of the firm in perfect competition is a firm in which entrepreneurship and management play no roles.''

Marx:
''If all commodities exchange for the value of the quantities of labour embodied in them, Marx asked, what is the source of capitalist profit, i.e. surplus value?''

''Marx argued that the tendency of capitalist development was to generate a `reserve army' of unemployed labour that would keep wages at a culturally determined minimum—the dark side of market forces —while giving capitalist employers the power to extract high levels of labour effort, and hence surplus value, from their employees in the production process''

Marx predicted that automation would results in male workers being replaced by cheaper labour - women and children. This didn't happen because cooperation between workers and capitalists resulted in increase in productivity even with increased automation. Further, innovation is driven by this process leading to the ``innovative enterprise''.

''Innovation is a collective, cumulative and uncertain process.''

''The innovative enterprise develops productive resources through collective and cumulative learning processes ... `` (organisational learning). the costs of this are offset by the ability of firm to gain greater market share - outperform firms who are merely optimising - and overcome technological and market uncertainties. 

However, still competitive uncertainty and so much invest in human capital. This also requires government spending on public goods and often utilises subsidies and other government support.

In early stages of the most to large scale production, where requirements are ambiguous, users are more likely than manufacturers to produce an innovation

New products with diversity and uncertainty are perhaps easier for smaller enterprises to work with/make a success of

Change may result from small start-ups or from state sponsorship

After radical innovation comes evolutionary innovation related to dominant product design, increased price competition and emphasis on process innovations

The field is important because STI is important - it is a source of progress, a major contributor to the wealth of nations, provides the basis for new goods and services and for new capabilities, and contributes to changes in the quality of life and the environment. As globalisation and international competition increase, STI is gaining even greater importance. It also carries risks, however, and social costs. For these reasons, effective policies to encourage and manage STI are essential. This Seminar Briefing summarises Prof Martin's presentation of the results of his research on how the field of science policy research has evolved and advanced in the 50 years since its inception and how it has affected decision making.},

Note we are looking at smart revolution in tech but environmental crises mean green revolution in lifestyle: smart green

Green is a direction for innovation and investment. Tech is enabler of local, 'traditional'

Vital to nurture the lifestyle aspiration especially in growing countries China and India

Also need to shift to intangible products and also redesign regulatory frameworks, social behaviours. Some of this is being seen in EU.

Environmental risks and disasters are likely to pay a role in the shift

- Mutually compatible and reinforcing

Say's Law, ppl will work to produce products earning wage which they will spend on those products. Keynes rejected this.

Classical economics assumes full employment and no involuntary unemployment, which became obviously a false premise in 1920s

Keynes initially challenges government policy and argued for deficits funding of programmes to reduce unemployment in 1920s but couldn't do this until he produced a general theory in 1930s

Keynes introduced quantity theory of money, that amount of money in system has impacts. Considered investment expenditure, creates extend precariousness and instability, a consumer multiplier, household and firm expenditure.

Different interpretations of Keynes:
Hydraulic
Fundamentalist
Modified equilibrium
      Prices are sticky, wages (a price) do not flexibly change with shocks. 

But it seems Keynes was misinterpreted and it may be that Keynesian isn't Keynes's

Leijonhufvud presented main Keynes innovation as about private enterprise market economy responds to demand shocks when which price and wage flexibility and complete information are nothing more than fiction

Leijonhufvud also refers to what comes later (rational expectations) as ``... movies: more and more simple-minded plots but ever more mind-boggling special effects''

Degrowth business

Decreased productivity
...

Degrowth business is a firm whose operations are aimed at, and correspond to, economy aimed at downscaling of economic activities via material and energy throughput reduction, increase in wellbeing, alongside a shift in values. 

Degrowth business is for the satisfaction of needs, focus no longer on profit-maximisation. No longer growth, capitalism, productivism, consumerism, competition, etc

A firm should understand that economy and society are embedded within the biosphere and operate accoridingly

Some businesses are suitable for degrowth, others (e.g. fashion, advertising) may not be

Ends with question of how to measure success under this regime?

Gives a thorough background to orthodox ideas of public administration theories and practise and why it is being rejected by some economists.

Markets are always imperfect and thus not `constrained Pareto-efficient'. This left to analysis that looked at 'net-welfare benefit' which led to one of the main justifications for cost-benefit analysis.

Market failure is only necessary condition of government intervention. However, it is not sufficient because 'bureau-maximising' behaviour of state departments means that intervention should only occur if benefits outweight costs of market- and government-failure.

Because of government failture, New Public Management argued that governments should adopt value-maximising strategies with efficiency targets etc.

In contrast, Moore developed `public value account' which was absorbed into Blair/Clinton 'Third Way' and included measuring outcomes and evidence-based approach to definitions of value that changed over time.

Similarly, Stoker argued for `public value management'.

From Ostrom, co-production developed with user-shaped and personalised public services. In particular, the Government Digital Service rejected the New Public Management ideas and focused on the role of citizens as users. Similarly, BBC presented concept of public value to justify public funds.

There are limitations of PVM e.g. around methods of measuring the value to the public, and that public can change views and even hold multiple views at one time.

Description of how laissez-faire can only exist paired with interventionism  and discussion of actual use of instruments such as taxation. Great for references.

This paper argues for moving beyond idea that public good is not about fixing a market failure but an end in itself. Collective value creation, new ways to engage the public, new evaluation indicators, consideration of how value is shared.

Founded on the distinction the Schumpeter drew between two contexts for action:
- neoclassical: when economic activity occurs in a continuous circular flow, actors have full understanding
- evolutionary economics: when innovation is going on, actors can never understand full the context

Goes on to demonstrate how neoclassical economics and the market organisation has a poor link to much in technology policy - e.g. incentives for public good and externaties. It is `intellectually strained' to raionalise much of the public realm (air traffic control, public health, etc) because of market failure.

Virtually all R\&D yields externalities - others can learn from this R\&D. Firms are often knowledgeable about their fields and can direct their research with incentives such as patents. But basic research is often better understood in the public sphere and here the interest is in open science.

The issues is not whether markets fail but how to get the job done.

Thinking of innovation as a system with multiple diverse actors and instruments does not require recourse to market failure. Institutions evolve and policymaking is a continuing process.

Goes into detail the innovation around pharmaceuticals. Patents are important for profits but contraversial because it can lead to ``evergreening'' and limits to access by low income countries.},

Regulatory instruments may be important indirectly, e.g. by restricting supply of inputs they incentivise innovation with different inputs

Most economic instruments operate on the supply side - development and diffusion of innovation. An example of demand-side is public procurement of innovation (PPI) - China is doing this

Soft instruments, often termed `governance', is growing and ``transformed the role of the government from being a provider and regulator to being a coordinator and facilitator [9]''

Lists 10 activites in the system of innovation and says that instruments will act on one or more of these. These are divided into four groups:
1. Provision of knowledge inputs for the innovation process
2. Demand-side activities
3. Provision of constituents for the systems of innovation

1. Idealising theoretical rationales and policy makers
policy rationales are likely to acreete in layers because new ideas are implemented in a landscape shaped by older ones. `Policy monopolies' and `policy entrapreneurs'

2. Treating policies as tools from a toolbox
But `interpretive flexibility' - policies carry different meanings from time to time, place to place, actor to actor. Not necessarily stable over time and do not work in isolation.

3. Too much faith in rational design coordination of `policy mixes'
Somewhat critical of BorrasE2013: ``Whilst the OECD acknowledges the significant co-ordination challenges presented by the sheer complexity and flexibility of the mix of policies likely to have an influence on innovation processes, [BorrasE2013] downplay these challenges. In their idealised approach, coherence will come from careful attention to problem identification and policy mix design''. But policy mixes have emergent behaviour. Scarce evidence for the value of `systemic' instruments and `strategic policy intelligence' tools such as foresight exercises to build more coherent policy visions.

4. An atemporal approach to innovation policy
dynamics unfold and interact over time, goals, rationales and instruments will emerge, evolve and fade away. Adaptive implementers are needed.

Identify some ways forward
- study of innovation processes for highlighting possibilities and challenges for policy implementation
- mutual adaptive co-ordination, informed by contextual knowledge
- pay more attention to the role of agency in making and breaking policy path dependencies and the roles institutions play in enabling and constraining action
- includes learning from failure, active experimentation and trial and error
- draw attention to uncertainties and trade-offs, such as the balance
between decentralised experimentation and the need to learn and rapidly transfer lessons, or the wider hidden complexities, uncertainties, and trade-offs between inevitably conflicting policy goals, encouraging open debate and shedding light on the hidden politics behind innovation policy choices


Useful for references for studies of innovation policy implementation in different countries and sectors

Craig Berry's summary:
1. Don't idealise the theoretical rationale of policy-makers - they are not passive recipients of policy recommendations
There are multiple policy actors with varying interests, knowledge, biases
Need to see policy as just as layered and evolutionary as innovation; e.g. policy-makers may hold onto `market failure' rationale even as systemic thinking emerges
1. Don't treat policies as tools from a toolbox
Instruments have different meaning and application in different contexts
Little evidence that any one set of innovation policy tools is most effective
1. Don't put too much faith in rational design and coherent policy `mix'
`Public policy necessarily pursues a broad and ever-changing range of more or less explicit and implicit, final and intermediate goals and objectives. It must also react to urgent and often unforeseen problems'
1. Don't forget path dependency

Chapter 2: Covers traditional policy analysis, its nature, history and current state. Later in the book, say that ``this approach assumes problems can be solved'' p143

Chapter 3: A second way of applying policy is around our organisation and organisations. 

Discussion of how we organise to deliver on policy. Economists have dominated in policy because, unlike sociologists and political scientists, they are willing to make predictions. 

Economists would have it that decisions relating to public goods (e.g. healthcare or education) should be made by the service user (who may not know best or have a broad knowledge base) or provider (who may be conflicted by any fee that they receive).

Chapter 4: A third way is to perform research to identify solutions.

Discussion of science and technology policy. This has tended to be about natural not social sciences. But just because physics is a powerful discipline, does not mean we can apply it to solve the problems of the world.

Significant advances in the social science method are required. Questions about who decides what research is done, and how. The outcomes of research should be considered a public good and scientists allowed a degree of autonomy. Economists see this differently though.

Chapter 5: The three traditions set out on chapters 2-4 (poliucy analysis, organisational design and research direction, are all confident that solutions can be found . But there is overselling of poorly evidenced prescriptions. Economists with concepts, logic and cost-benefit analysis (CBA) ``the rigor of their arguments has tended to bedazzle the eyes and to take away from the shabbiness of their predictions'' p76.

We probably need a new way of looking at policy problems at least a combination of existing traditions. 

Chapter 6: A detailed study of childcare provision - a policy problem. 

Private for-profit is not fully trusted and public provision is perceived as uniform. The market doesn't work because there is not perfect information and so some way of allowing observation of childcare in progress is needed. Also non-profit organisations don't tend to expand if the need increases so a body is required to oversee this to encourage increases in provision where required.

Chapter 7: A study of state sponsored R\&D into supersonic flight and nuclear energy.

The state supports agriculture, medicare but supersonic flight and nuclear don't fit in here. In the US, these were supported because some individuals in government could see that rate development was not matching its potential. Success in technology cannot be orderly. CBA does not go deep enough.

Discussion of change, adaptation and responses with respect to the organisation and innovation p137

Organisations have, separately: demand, supply and innovation generation. However their interaction is essential. p139

Discussion of regulation of supply, the flexibility of supply and the quality of supply p141

The producers interests should count for very little - the consumer should be priority. p151 
But CBA nets the consumers' losses with the producers' gains p152

``certain things are not well known and those who propose solutions are either charlatans or fools'' p153

From Kattel lecture - this books says that we cannot solve the ghetto problem if we continue to look for answers in science - these problems are too complex.},

Geels Multi-level perspective (MLP) theory of transitions has been developed since first publication 2002  by developing ideas, in response to criticism and by other authors. This paper takes the MLP theory and looks at other related theories in different fields and compares them with MLP, highlighting aspects that are borrowed and are crossovers.

This is a useful paper to return to for detail on MLP as well as the related theories of Social construction of technology (SCOT), Evolutionary economics and Neo-institutional theory.

The basic idea MLP is that technological innovations occur in niches. Some will gradually building up internal momentum and may place some pressure on the wider socio-technical regime (e.g. markets, industry, policy, science, etc) which may resist the change. The regime also exists within a wider socio-technical landscape which is external. Developments in the landscape also puts pressure on the regime and the niches. Changes in landscape open up windows of opportunity for the innovations to break into the regime which both changes the regime and the landscape.

SCOT sits within the Science and Technologies Studies (STS) field (this is discussed in Martin2012). ``innovation is a social process of aligning heterogeneous elements, which involves actors moving between spheres such as science, markets, regulation and production.'' Core notions from SCOT within MLP are thet the MLP conceptualises technologies as socially constructed, rather than developing according to an internal technical logic, shares the broader STS assessment that science and technology are omnipresent in modern societies, and have contributed to major transformations in agro-food, energy, transport, housing, entertainment, and communication in the last two centuries.

``Evolutionary economics has two complementary components, which are relevant for transitions and the MLP. Macro-evolution addresses long-term techno-economic patterns ... Schumpeter (1939: 102) ... Micro-evolution concerns mechanisms of variation, selection and retention that underlie genealogical lineages and trajectories ... Nelson and Winter (1982)''. The ideas of transition are part of MLP (later MLP accommodates more gradual transitions, however). The regime, technological trajectory and path dependence in MLP are derived from evolutionary economics. Other aspect of MLP come from evolutionary biology.
 
Neo-institutional theory: Institutional theory is important, because “rules, norms, and belief systems undergird all stable social systems, including economic systems” (Scott, 2008: 437). Fits especially with the regimes aspect.


``Institutional theory emphasizes that organizations operate not only in economic environments, but also in institutional environments'' - competition is for social fitness, which arises from appropriateness or legitimacy. These may influence reputation, license-to-operate, access to capital and government support are 

Transitions research

``Framing struggles are consequential because it matters if a problem like climate change is framed as a `market failure' (which would lead to market-based instruments such as a carbon tax) or as a `planetary boundary' (which may lead to stronger regulatory or innovation policies with greater urgency). It also matters how specific innovations are framed: are wind turbines seen as renewable energy technologies or as ugly artefacts that spoil the landscape and kill birds? Are nuclear plants framed as low-carbon technologies or as existential threats? The implication is that transitions should not only be seen as techno-economic management challenges, but also as socio-cultural processes which involve wider publics and cultural meanings.''},

We date the Electrification era from 1894 until 1930, and the IT era from 1971 until the present. While we document some differences between the two technologies, we follow David [In: Technology and Productivity: The Challenge for Economic Policy (1991) 315-347] and emphasize their similarities. Our main findings are: 1.Productivity growth in the two GPT eras tended to be lower than it was in other periods, with productivity slowdowns taking place at the start of the two eras and the IT era slowdown stronger than that seen during Electrification.2.Both GPTs were widely adopted, but electricity's adoption was faster and more uniform over sectors.3.Both improved as they were adopted, but measured by its relative price decline, IT has shown a much faster improvement than Electricity did.4.Both have spawned innovation, but here, too, IT dominates Electricity in terms of the number of patents and trademarks issued.5.Both were accompanied by a rise in “creative destruction” and turbulence as measured by the entry and exit of firms, by mergers and takeovers, and by changing valuations on the stock exchange. In sum, Electrification spread faster than IT has been spreading, and it did so more evenly and broadly over sectors. Also, IT comprises a smaller fraction of the physical capital stock than electrified machinery did at its corresponding stage. On the other hand, IT seems to be technologically more dynamic; the ongoing spread of IT and its continuing precipitous price decline are reasons for optimism about productivity growth in the 21st century.},

3. Innovation spawning - The GPT should make it easier to invent and produce new products or processes.

Considers the last 5 major recessions (1920-21, 1929-32, 1973-75, 1979-82 and 1989-93) and looks at evidence for:
(a) the reaction to a shock of consumers - largely about prospects and optimism in terms of consumption, dept creation and dept repayment. Identifies that confidence is not necessarily in line with economic fluctuations since consumer will carry past experience forward. Finds that `expections' assumes more clarity of the future than most comsumers have.
(b) the reaction of business - investments are in response to confidence and can have an amplifying (sometimes stabilising) effect on output fluctuations meaning that stock changes contributed to almost all recessions
(c) the reaction of the whole system - ``Consumers' behaviour and firms' investment behaviour together determine the economy's response to shocks, and go far to determine macro fluctuations.''

``In all major recessions, fixed investment was heavily affected and in most cases constituted a fair share of the recession (e.g. a quarter). In two cases (1973 and 1979) this was in part the result of contractionary monetary policy. In all cases it probably reflected also a lessening of confidence induced by the fall in output. Loss of confidence evidently also affected consumer spending in some cases. Thus, changes in mood seem to have been a factor in all major recessions.''

  abstract         = {{This book is mostly about demand, and how in the short term fluctuations in demand cause fluctuations in output and productivity growth. Over the longer term, major variations in growth rates have undoubtedly originated from the supply rather than the demand side. The aim of this chapter is to summarize what is known in general about variations in the rate of growth; and to argue that the kind of effects that supply‐side factors have is different from what is needed to explain the abrupt short‐term falls in output that occur in major recessions. The discussion thus touches on a large subject of which knowledge is incomplete, but since its relevance is indirect, discussion is brief and touches only on what is essential for the present purpose: Sect. 4.1 summarizes what is known about variations in growth rates; Sect. 4.2 first gives a general explanation--eclectic but not basically novel for the process of growth, and then goes on to offer explanations for some particular ways in which growth rates have varied since 1920; Sect. 4.3 summarizes conclusions. There are two short appendices: Appendix A4.l is a note on growth accounting and two other studies of growth; Appendix A4.2 gives estimates of the growth of output and exports of manufactures of six countries from 1870 to 1970.}},
  comment          = {``The conclusion I come to is that major long‐term variations in the rate of growth of productivity—in the same country over time and also between countries—have probably originated (chiefly) on the supply side. On the other hand, the kind of abrupt short‐term falls in output, productivity, and employment that occur in major recessions—usually in many countries simultaneously or at nearly the same time—must have originated largely or entirely from the demand side, and must occur essentially through the effect of recession on employment and on (human and physical) investment''},

The questions involved extend beyond those dealt with earlier, and raise not only the disputable issues of economic theory but also many new ones, including broadly political questions. Section 12.1 deals with background issues, attributing a degree of effectiveness to policy, and recapitulating this and other respects in which the author's view differs from a neoclassical view; the general limits to state action are then discussed, and finally a view is set out about inflation. Section 12.2 deals with general questions about the instruments of economic policy; despite the waves of deconstruction that are generally taken to have destroyed the intellectual foundations for a Keynesian fiscal policy, the author sees a theoretical case for it--along with severe practical limits that stem from the reactions of financial markets to government borrowing; the section goes on to discuss the effect and role of monetary policy. Section 12.3 turns to practical possibilities, and considers the kind of action that, despite the above constraints presented, ought to be possible; Sect. 12.4 then assesses the likelihood that governments will avoid or minimize major recessions in the future.}},

However, with the rise of Neoclassical economics in the late 19th century, production has lost its status as the ultimate interest of economics. Several opportunities for fruitful integration of alternative streams of economics research—Evolutionary, Structuralist and Keynesian in particular—have been also missed. Even the humanist approaches to development, such as Sen's Human Capability Approach, paid little attention to the domain of production. In this article, we argue that the fragmentation of the production-centred paradigm has weakened both academic research and policy-making related to economic development. We introduce and discuss eight articles developed around the special issue theme of Bringing Production Back into Development. We argue that a renewed `productionist' agenda is essential to address the structural challenges faced by developing countries, even more so after the revelation of structural weaknesses by the pandemic.},

  comment          = {Critiques current view of development which is a combination of Neoclassical (NC) (from after WWII) with Amartya Sen's Capability Approach (CA) (from 1980s). 

Whilst production was fundamental to classical ideas about development, NC became increasing fixated on markets resulting in:
1. production is a black box
2. technological and organisation learning in production is  barely considered
3. assumptions that production is homogeneous
4. economy is framed as transaction between individuals (atomistic assumption)
5. bias towards consumption

CA criticised NC but remained:
1. individualistic, neglecting the collective dimensions of the economy
2. focused on consumption being key to human welfare, neglecting the role of production (e.g. that a job is about more than earning to consume)

Result is neglect of full and productive employment as a critical dimension of development

By focussing on markets rather than production, economic consequences could include undermining the innovative effects of large organisations if policies implemented to correct monopolies without descretion

By considering production homogeneous, policies are applied across whole economy rather than providing selective supports

The atomistic assumption neglects behaviour inside organisations and their collective nature

Pro-consumer (rather than producer) (a bit like Say's Law) leads to policies to alleviate poverty rather than un/under-employment

Proposes New Developmentalist Perspective

* Recognise the ``inevitably collective nature of the production process''
* ``Productive structures are ecomplex social organisations''
* transformation of production will transform institutions, society and ideology
* Production is heterogeneous inputs, outputs, firms, production units
* Physical effort may be reduced, intellectual effort increased

Looks at Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) 
* Undervaluing of production

Another easy read from Chang!

NL `unholy' alliance between neoclassical (NC) (analytical tools) and Austrian-libertarian (political and moral philosophy)

State cannot be assumed to be impartical, onmipotent social guardian but self-seeking politicians under pressure from interest groups leads to government failures

NL absorbed welfare economics as it was `non-commital' (unlike Keynesianism) and and found ways to avoid state intervention such as minimising the state, prioritising entrepreneurship and finding interventionist policy too difficicult or dangerous

I understand that NC was still dominant in academia but NL in politics - not sure if NL ever really existed in academia?

NL has limitations that are rarely interrogated:
* foundation of free-market is flawed, all markets are regulated e.g. child labour is illegal
* market failures exist but are inconsistenly understood/defined. Failures of the market (e.g. inequality) are irrelevant in NC economics. Also a perfect market to NC is a non-competitive market failure in Schumpeterian economics (because innovations are immediately dissipated destroying the incentives for entrapreneurship. Markets are only. Instead says that institutional economics sees markets as one of many institutions of the capitalist economy
* despite definitive counter-evidence, NL tends to assume that markets came before states. And yet evidence is that states have both created and shaped markets.
* NL see markets as non-political but they demonstrably are: rights, wages, standards, entitlements, immigration control - all have political dimension

IPE is not New Institutionalist Economics but founded on work of Marx, Veblen, Schumpter, Polanyi and others

Includes acceptance that human motivations are varied, complexly interacting and institutions play a role in this

Introduced The Calculus of Consent with two-level  framework of ordinary politics (decisions made by voting) and constitutional politics (decisions made according to frameworks)

``Public choice includes both `methodological individualism' and `rational choice', directly from economic theory to the analysis of politics. At one level of abstraction, these two elements are themselves relatively empty of empirical content. To model the behavior of persons, whether in markets or in politics, as maximizing utilities, and as behaving rationally in so doing, does not require specification of the arguments in utility functions. Economists go further than this initial step, however, when they identify and place arguments into the categories of `goods' and `bads'. Persons are then modeled as acting so as to maximize some index of “goods” and to minimize some index of `bads'.'' - provides some justification for this approach.

Change in opinion towards belief that high rewards were needed to provide incentives and drive productivity and that mobility meant people would not get stuck even if tail of the income distribution were getting bigger (aka increasing inequality)

Until 1970s, governments were assumed to be concerned with maximising social welfare and to have all the information they needed

oil crisis (1973-4) (major supply shock), depression, inflation, unemployment - all as Friedman predicted and Keynsian theory could not account for

Regulation was seen as creating perverse incentives and distorting resource allocation

Work on Public Choice Theory in 1960s developed ideas around government optimising social welfare function with assumptions that state is inefficient and state actors are motivated by their own ends

competition introduced into the electricity and gas

Hayek has earlier (1930s) critiqued socialism.

Public Choice Theory and Hayek were theoretical but real-world experience of stated owned enterprises and regulating the private sector seemed to bare out thesee ideas

Nordhaus1975 model of the manipulation of policy to maximise chances of reelection by myopic voters

In 1950s and 60s ideas included selective industrialisation and protection and import substiution to develop. In 1970s interst turned to the application of standard economics based on utility and profit maximisation. in the 1980s emphasis on fiscal discipline and market liberalisation latbelled as Washington Consensus in 1990 by John Williamson.

As an alternative to Marxism, rational choice liberalism had three broad elements:
- self-interested rational actor
- set-theoretic and axiomatic treatment of human rationality
- commitment to univrsal and objective scientific law

Keynes, Toynbee, Russell, Spengler, Eliot and Schumpeter had all argued that capitalism would collapse.


Think tanks played a huge role in spreading ideas and influencing politicians, some wanting to avoid socialism that would result from capitalisms collapse, also looking to counter how ideas from the liberal (left) Brookings Institution were entering policy and counter the New Deal coalition. Influenced Thatcher and Reagan: including RAND Corporation, Mont Pelerin Society and Institute of Economic Affairs

Univerisities and instiutional organisations also played a part: University of Chicago (Friedman), Public Choice Society, Thomas Jerfferson Center, Center for Study of Public Choice, (New York University, George Mason and Auburn) (``Austrians'')

In the 1980s IMF became involved in more than providing short-term loads, negotiating credit packages. World Bank made loads with conditions of liberalising economies.

Rather than a market economy, we have an organisational economy. However the boundary between markets and organisations is blurred, and varies with society within which the markets and organisations sit

In employees utility function, work is usually considered to have negative utility (loafing/shirking has positive utility). Neoclassical economics says that it's the contract that motivates the employee to accept authority and leaves the utility function open to be specified. However this doesn't stack up - many employees go beyond contact and contracts are usually ``incomplete''

``New institutional economics and related approaches are acts of faith, out perhaps piety''

Firm size and number has Pareto distribution - this didn't match ideas of optimum firm size but does indicate a probabilistic mechanism

There is a gap between ownership and control, goals of owners - profit, goals of managers - career status, wealth, quiet life

New institutional economics finds that employment achieves great savings on transaction costs

Factors in organisations:
- Rewards as motivators - these are difficult to specify especially in roles with a great deal of interdependence and evidence is that rewards alone have limited motivational effect
 - Loyalty and identification with organisational goals - discussion of `docility' and how it leads to altruism and positive outcomes for organisations that cultivate loyalty and [I guess what we now call engagement]
- Coordination - probably emerges out of necessities it at least efficiencies and allows actors to form more stable expectations. Coordination probably has wholly economic motivations and rewards when it is between organisations but within them it combats externalities

Note Devons' point that if markets had a simplifying effect, why is it we turn to central planning on complex situations such as war

  abstract         = {Controversy over EU-wide biofuel policy resonated within the UK, fuelling policy disagreements among UK public authorities. They disagreed over how to protect a space for future second-generation biofuels, which were expected to overcome harm from first-generation biofuels. The UK government defended rising targets for available biofuels as a necessary stimulus for industry to help fulfil the UK's EU obligations and eventually develop second-generation biofuels. By contrast, Parliamentary Select Committees opposed biofuel targets on grounds that these would instead lock-in first-generation biofuels, thus delaying or pre-empting second-generation biofuels. Those disagreements can be explained by different institutional responsibilities and reputational stakes towards `promise-requirement cycles', whereby techno-optimistic promises generate future requirements for the actors involved. The UK government's stance illustrates a `policy-promise lock-in', a dilemma whereby promised support is a requirement for credibility towards technology innovators and thus technoscientific development - but may delay the redirection of support from incumbent to preferable emerging technologies. Thus the sociology of expectations - previously applied to technological expectations from technology innovators - can be extended to analyse public authorities.},
  comment          = {Expectations create a set of `promises' which can then be converted into requirements

Thus governments act as selectors of technological expectations

Interesting questions raised over setting policy that is stable enough to build confidence and stimulate innovation and yet flexible enough to avoid ``policy-promise lock-in'' if problems arise with early stage developments that arise from policy.

``Promises and diffuse scenarios are used to convince funding organisations to invest money and attract other practitioners to join the development (Geels and Smit, 2000: 881). Technology innovators may exaggerate their promises''


November 2001 the European Commission had started formal negotiations on an EU Directive on Biofuels (EC, 2001), which became law in May 2003 (EU, 2003)

July 2002 the UK government introduced the first financial incentive: a fuel duty discount only for biodiesel (20p per litre)

2003 Department of Trade and Industry (DTI)3 published an Energy White Paper considered biofuels as an “important potential route for achieving the goal of zero-carbon transport, creating new opportunities for agriculture in the UK as well as globally” (DTI, 2003: 69). This was a policy change from previous focus on hydrogen fuel.

Later in 2003 the European Commission issued the first EU Biofuels Directive, initiating an EU-wide biofuel policy (EU, 2003). The Directive set non-binding “reference” targets through 2010, requiring increasing proportions of all diesel and petrol sold in Member States to be biofuels

In 2003 Parliament's Environment, Food and Rural Affairs Committee (EFRAC) acknowledged lack of knowledge on impacts and recommended the development of an auditing system on biofuels' environmental and socio-economic impacts in producer countries which UK gov doubted would be practically feasible

2005: UK government announcing future implementation of the Renewable Transport Fuel Obligation (RTFO), whose mandatory targets started incentivising biofuel production from 2008 onwards but, owing to uncertainty about benefits RTFO's mandatory targets were more cautious than the EU's higher reference target of 5.75\% per energy content6 by 2010

2006-7 NGOs turned against biofuels - first-generation biofuels were widely recognised as environmentally and socio-economically problematic - and called for a policy moratorium

Gallagher Review 2008 [official enquiry on biofuels] acknowledged drawbacks of biofuels but rejected the idea of a moratorium because this would damage investment in biofuels

This led to a slow-down UK biofuel targets in 2009 and increased R\&D funding for second generation biofuels.

https://doi.org/10.1068/c09206j argued that biofuel advocates “successfully transplanted their ecomodernist discourse into policy makers' consciousness and vocabularies” saying that the advocates' discourse had “superior appeal” compared to biofuel critics.

By 2008 UK targets were explicitly defended as `cautious' in response to high-profile calls for a moratorium, and were eventually delayed in 2009. This caution relates to the risk of locking in a nascent industry for first-generation biofuels, which the UK government initially presented as environmentally and socio-economically risky and excessively expensive (EFRAC, 2004gr: 6; HM Govt, 2004: 2).

This article makes four contributions to the approach by addressing some open issues. The first contribution is to explicitly incorporate the user side in the analysis. Hence, the unit of analysis is widened from sectoral systems of innovation to socio-technical systems. The second contribution is to suggest an analytical distinction between systems, actors involved in them, and the institutions which guide actor's perceptions and activities. Thirdly, the article opens up the black box of institutions, making them an integral part of the analysis. Institutions should not just be used to explain inertia and stability. They can also be used to conceptualise the dynamic interplay between actors and structures. The fourth contribution is to address issues of change from one system to another. The article provides a coherent conceptual multi-level perspective, using insights from sociology, institutional theory and innovation studies. The perspective is particularly useful to analyse long-term dynamics, shifts from one socio-technical system to another and the co-evolution of technology and society.},

Minsky's financial instability hypothesis is that during a boom, private actors (households, banks, etc) take on debt. During a 'bust' they tighten their belts and pay down debt.

Keynes identified that the spending multiplier works in reverse - a diminution in aggregate spending causes even less spending

However, with a large enough state, there is an automatic balance - tax will decline and draws on the welfare state will increase, creating a government deficit (not because of decisions by the current administration)

Traditional to think of government deficits as something that requires borrowing  which takes resources from savers and crowds out other economic activity

Instead, it should be seen as a flow of funds that increases the stock of net financial assets to the non-government sector

NC economics states that, on observing a fiscal deficit, private sector agents will anticipate a rise in taxes and therefore will save rather than spend

Great narrative of the aftermath of 2008 financial crisis especially in Eurozone also US and UK

Estate taxation had been introduced in response to threat and actual war, then repealed, repeatedly but had stayed in place after WWI. It was reduced in response to budget surpluses. This was part of redistribution of wealth although was hotly debated and fluctuated for some years. In 1920s there was a battle over estate taxation - whether to raise/broaden or lower it

Revenue Act of 1932 in response to falling revenue after 1929 stock market crash, with increased taxation provisions was to address deficit as congress was agreed that this budget needed balancing to aid recovery. However, it did not include any borrowing despite some arguing for this.

This act had no expiration date - possibly an error or a `slight of hand'

Basically, if you thought that market actors were self-interested, wait til you see what motivates government actors and bureaucrats, who have been captured by interest groups. As a consequence, we need to subject all government actors to competition to ensure scrutiny and remove opportunity for acting in their own self interest. Supplies almost no empirical evidence.

Its very difficult not to read this as a treatise from a group that want to own most of the state.

Public choice scholars `pointed out' that the people who make public decision are just as self-interested as anyone else

Political parties have very strong objective to get elected

Buchanan and Tullock saw the political system as a process by which individuals seek to protect their own interests rather than strive to achieve some public interest...the real problem was government failure, monopoies, externalities and limited or one-sided information were much more evident in government than markets

Lobby groups are successful at winning concessions but they don't represent consumers because consumers have a wider set of concerns and are more numerous and thus harder to organise. A reason that consuders don't get involved in lobbying is that they can see someone else doing it and thus they free-ride the benefits.

Government may be employed to do important things that the market does not deliver (well)

``the problems that government intervention creates can be even more damanging than those it is intended to correct''

Elections are a problem because different outcomes can occur depending on the system employed. Also, voters tend to not express their true beliefs because, for instance, they vote tactically. Another problem is that elections are very infrequent whereas markets are constantly adjusting.

The general public have little motivation to put much effort into public debate. They are rationally ignorant, since they can influence things very little. It is not obvious why they bother to vote.

Public activities are not paid for my tax but rather a debt to be paid by future generations

Political parties choose policies because they think they will win not because they think they are right

Logrolling is always happening whereby multiple policies are put in together in order to get agreement from otherwise opposing sides

Rent seeking occurs when government give themselves monopolies over the provision of services. This ``massively distorts'' public decisions, markets and reduces competition and benefits certain groups.

Bureaucrats are motivated by the size of their budgets and are not exposed to the scrutiny of well-informed customers (unlike business people). There is a threat that bureaucrats will humble their political masters by leaking damaging information.

``so much state spending has been captured by special interest groups''

Relative poverty amongst working-age adults is expected to rise from 16.7
per cent (2011/12) to 18.5 per cent (2014/15). By 2020, relative poverty is expected to rise between three to four
percentage points to 24.4 per cent among children and 20.0 per cent among working-age adults.

Over the decade to 2020, an additional 800,000 children are expected to
be living in poverty - almost one in four British children.1},

  abstract         = {Objective Since 2010, England has experienced relative constraints in public expenditure on healthcare (PEH) and social care (PES). We sought to determine whether these constraints have affected mortality rates.Methods We collected data on health and social care resources and finances for England from 2001 to 2014. Time trend analyses were conducted to compare the actual mortality rates in 2011{\textendash}2014 with the counterfactual rates expected based on trends before spending constraints. Fixed-effects regression analyses were conducted using annual data on PES and PEH with mortality as the outcome, with further adjustments for macroeconomic factors and resources. Analyses were stratified by age group, place of death and lower-tier local authority (n=325). Mortality rates to 2020 were projected based on recent trends.Results Spending constraints between 2010 and 2014 were associated with an estimated 45 368 (95\% CI 34 530 to 56 206) higher than expected number of deaths compared with pre-2010 trends. Deaths in those aged >=60 and in care homes accounted for the majority. PES was more strongly linked with care home and home mortality than PEH, with each {\textsterling}10 per capita decline in real PES associated with an increase of 5.10 (3.65{\textendash}6.54) (p\&lt;0.001) care home deaths per 100 000. These associations persisted in lag analyses and after adjustment for macroeconomic factors. Furthermore, we found that changes in real PES per capita may be linked to mortality mostly via changes in nurse numbers. Projections to 2020 based on 2009-2014 trend was cumulatively linked to an estimated 152 141 (95\% CI 134 597 and 169 685) additional deaths.Conclusions Spending constraints, especially PES, are associated with a substantial mortality gap. We suggest that spending should be targeted on improving care delivered in care homes and at home; and maintaining or increasing nurse numbers.},

Key messages
The UK has an important international leadership role to play in driving global implementation, underpinned by action at home:

* Defining the UK's role. The delayed 2030 Strategic Framework (the Government's vision for the UK's long-term international role tackling climate change and biodiversity loss) is an opportunity to set out the UK's leadership role in helping the world achieve the goals of the Paris Agreement.
* Future COPs and UK diplomatic capability. After exiting the EU and convening COP26, the UK Government should decide what its priorities are in COP negotiations and communicate these at a high level. The relationships and capabilities built through the Presidency should be used to actively champion progress towards the goals of the Paris Agreement and take forward the delivery of pledges and initiatives.
* Mobilising finance. As a major finance centre and sponsor of the multilateral development banks, the UK should pay particular attention to its positions on mobilising finance, which are vital to global success on climate change, and how it contributes to future Just Energy Transition Partnerships.
* Delivering the UK's contributions to the Paris Agreement. The UK must implement its Net Zero Strategy to deliver its legislated domestic targets and international commitments. It must strengthen its response on climate adaptation, which remains weak, with an ambitious, action-oriented third National Adaptation Programme in 2023.},

The corporation was devised, making it possible for many individuals to combine and undertake risky enterprises without one person having to risk all his fortune on one venture 

It is the fear of inflation which is the only rational basis for suspicion of the printing of money

One if the greatest deterrents to private investment is the fear that the depression will come before the investment has paid for itself 

The argument against deficit spending is answered with: 
1. The national debt does not have to keep on increasing
2. Even if the national debt does grow, the interest on it does not
have to be raised out of current taxes
3. Even if the interest on the debt is raised out of current taxes,
these taxes constitute only the interest on only a fraction of the
benefit enjoyed from the government spending, and are not lost
to the nation but are merely transferred from taxpayers to bond-
holders
4. High income taxes need not discourage investment, because
appropriate deductions for losses can diminish the capital actually
risked by the investor in the same proportion as his net income
from the investment is reduced.

Textbook economic theory holds that high levels of government debt make it more expensive for companies to borrow. But these days, interest rates are low, stock market prices are high relative to company earnings, and major companies hold large amounts of cash on their balance sheets. No one seriously argues that the cost of capital is holding back businesses from investing. Cutting the deficit, then, is unlikely to spur much private investment.''

``Higher levels of debt do have downsides. They could make it harder for governments to summon the political will to stimulate the economy in a downturn. But saying that a country would be better off with lower debt is not the same as saying that it would be better off lowering its debt. The risks associated with high debt levels are small relative to the harm cutting deficits would do.''

``There is a widely held misconception that the deficit has risen primarily because government programs have grown more generous. Not so. Deficits have ballooned because a series of tax cuts have dramatically reduced government revenue below past projections and historical levels. The tax cuts passed by Presidents George W. Bush and Donald Trump totaled three percent of gdp—much more than the projected increases in entitlement spending over the next 30 years.''

``Although the “optimal” size of government is not known, an accepted tenet of public finance is that beyond some level of revenue collection, the marginal net social costs - including the excess burden of taxation - of additional public expenditure increase more than proportionately with the additional taxation needed to finance spending. Against that background and given the current high level of public spending in many countries and the future spending pressures due to population ageing, the largest part of consolidation probably should consist of cuts in public spending. Since many countries rely on so-called tax expenditures for the pursuit of selected policy goals (e.g., home ownership), the reduction or elimination of base-eroding tax preferences will appear as revenue enhancements rather than spending cuts. In other cases where spending is low, there may be a case to put greater emphasis on revenue measures.''},

`` In macroeconomic policy, the neoclassical framework encouraged a view that high levels of government debt `crowd out' private investment, so fiscal deficits should be limited, and monetary policy (adjustments to interest rates) should play the primary role in controlling inflation and managing overall demand''

``In the period before the financial crisis, this economic model (often described as the `Washington Consensus') was strongly influenced by a particular form of economic analysis. Based on an orthodox version of `neoclassical' economic theory, this assumed that the liberalisation of markets would generally improve their efficiency in allocating resources, and would therefore tend to optimise overall economic welfare. Although markets sometimes failed - for example in the presence of negative externalities, or in the provision of public goods - governments were also seen as prone to failure. They tended to have less information than market actors, and to be captured vested interests. So policy rooted in this kind of analysis tended to be sceptical of government intervention, with deregulation of various kinds widely favoured.''

``Over the last decade (and in some fields for longer) policy makers have modified some aspects of this analytical framework. Drawing on longstanding developments in academic economics, it has been acknowledged that orthodox neoclassical analysis has limitations: that liberalised markets are not always efficient and market failures can be significant.33 Policy makers have recognised the need for greater government intervention, in fields such as labour market, regional and environmental policy, as well as in monetary and financial policy. In many of these fields, and others, the OECD has supported these new analytical and policy developments.''},

Rational Expectations was an idea introduced in the early 1970s, again initially incompatible with NC synthesis. - perceived variations in availability led to changes in price

Argument between left and right over size of state boils down to:
a. whether we expect state actors to make poor decisions about allocation
b. whether we trust more the wisdom of people acting via democratic or via market-based processes

And industrial strategy is not one if it aims to maintain an economy fuelled by rent-seeking and unproductive activities

Very critical of neoliberal dominance - task of progressives is to convinced those not well served by NL that a different economic model may serve them better

Treasury is UK key institution for industry although the May government's establishment of Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy (BEIS) seems to be trying to take away some of Treasury's power. Treasury tends to be sceptical of targetted industrial policies for fear of failure and distorted markets.

Main view of Treasury is that industrial policy is for increasing productivity. However, core problem is reduced to extracting greater value from labour inputs and this leads to neoliberal policies

Thus need to identify `positive tipping points' or `sensitive intervention points' (See Hepburn)

Positive tipping points are intentional

Many theories including: social-technical / socio-technical  systems, social-ecological systems, transitions management, Multi-level perspective (Geels), leverage points...

Needs to happen faster than theory current suggests (i.e. >20 years)

Theory of how to tip a system includes concepts include forcing, enabling conditions, system features and control variables

``the key challenge in indentifying tipping points is thus to indentify the cirtical control variable(s) and features of a particular system''

Aspect of current conceptualisation of this system is that change is being triggered by agents external to the system, and does not capture endogenous evolution of the system

Tipping points often occur when there is a critical mass of individuals, although sometimes other factors occur. After ZeppiniFK2014 there are a range of models, which incorporate ideas like
* increasing returns
* learning by doing
* economies of scale
* technological reinforcement
* coordination tipping point - only occurs with mass coordination of individuals like for EV charging points
* informational cascades
* herding behaviour
* percolation threshold

Three phases to operationalising positive tipping points:
* identifying and creating enabling conditions
  * population size
  * social network structure
  * information/capability
  * price
  * performance/quality
  * desirability/symbolism
  * accessibility/convenience
  * complementarity
* Sensing the potential - e.g. 
  * workshops to identify tipping points
  * citizens' assmeblies and juries
  * formalise mathematical model of change
  * agent-based modelling
  * changes in dynamical behaviour of system - e.g. reduced resilience whereby system takes longer to recover from perturbations, even possible early warning signs before past stock market bubbles

List *who* should drive the change, and *how*:
Social, technological, ecological innovations, policy interventions and public investment, private investment and markets, public information and behavioural nudges.

  abstract         = {A visit to a physician these days is cold: physicians spend most of their time typing at computers, making minimal eye contact. Appointments generally last only a few minutes, with scarce time for the doctor to connect to a patient's story, or explain how and why different procedures and treatments might be undertaken. As a result, errors abound: indeed, misdiagnosis is the fourth-leading cause of death in the United States, trailing only heart disease, cancer, and stroke. This is because, despite having access to more resources than ever, doctors are vulnerable not just to the economic demand to see more patients, but to distraction, burnout, data overload, and their own intrinsic biases. Physicians are simply overmatched.

As Eric Topol argues in Deep Medicine, artificial intelligence can help. Natural-language processing could automatically record notes from our doctor visits; virtual psychiatrists could better predict the risk of suicide or other mental health issues for vulnerable patients; deep-learning software will make every physician a master diagnostician; and we could even use smartphone apps to take our own medical "selfies" for skin exams and receive immediate analysis. . On top of that, the virtual smartphone assistants of today--Alexa, Siri, Cortana--could analyze our daily health data to reduce the need for doctor visits and trips to the emergency room, and support for people suffering from asthma, epilepsy, and heart disease. By integrating tools like these into their daily medical practice, doctors would be able to spend less time collecting and cataloging information, and more time providing thorough, intimate, and meaningful care for their patients, as no machine can.

Artificial intelligence can also help remedy the debilitating cost of healthcare, both for individuals and the economy writ large. The medical sector now absorbs 20 percent of the US gross domestic product--it is largest sector by dollars and jobs. And it's very inefficient. Take the cost of medical scans: There are over 20 million medical scans performed in the US every day, and an MRI, for example, costs hundreds to thousands of dollars. AI could process 260 million medical scans (more than 2 weeks' worth) in less than 24 hours for a cost of only $1000. We pay billions and billions of dollars for the same work today.

Although a third of Earth's largest groundwater basins are being depleted by irrigated agriculture2, little is known about the conditions that lead resource users to comply with conservation policies. Here we developed an agent-based model3,4of irrigated agriculture rooted in principles of cooperation5,6and collective action7and grounded on the World Values Survey Wave 6 (n = 90,350). Simulations of three major aquifer systems facing unsustainable demands reveal tipping points where social norms towards groundwater conservation shift abruptly with small changes in cultural values and monitoring and enforcement provisions. These tipping points are amplified by group size and best invoked by engaging a minority of rule followers. Overall, we present a powerful tool for evaluating the contingency of regulatory compliance upon cultural, socioeconomic, institutional and physical conditions, and its susceptibility to change beyond thresholds. Managing these thresholds may help to avoid unsustainable groundwater development, reduce enforcement costs, better account for cultural diversity in transboundary aquifer management and increase community resilience to changes in regional climate. Although we focus on groundwater, our methods and findings apply broadly to other resource management issues.},

Those actions of big tech, principally Google in this paper, that challenged existing social norms have been legally challenged. As a result google has obscured these activities, bypassing detection by users.

Analyses 100 historical societies and determines the severity of their crises based on 12 `consequences'. Finds 4 periods when none of these consequences materialises:
* Republican Rome: Conflict of the Orders (494-287 BCE)
* England: Chartist Movement: 1819-1867 CE
* Russia: Reform Period: 1855-1881 CE
* USA: Progressive Era: 1914-1939 CE

Looks at each of these in detail

Two different conclusions can be drawn from these periods
First that they were preceded by periods of land expansion which meant that wealth could be extracted and people exported 
Second that institutional reform restored popular wellbeing in all four cases

``The cases explored here suggest some possible answers. It appears incumbent on those with the greatest access to power, wealth, and authority to `future think' and recognize the signs of unrest early on. Crucially, elites must be willing to give up some private gains for the public good, for example through supporting welfare programs or promoting redistribution of wealth and labour autonomy to the working classes''},

Radical innovations are improved on by incremental innovations

Innovation doesn't happen in isolation, there are many agents of change in the collective process: suppliers, distributors and many others, including consumers. 

Radical innovations stimulate the growth of whole industries - and technology systems. These modify business, institutions and culture and require rules and regulations. Ultimately, these adaptations shape the technology itself

Goes on to discuss the 5 Technological Revolutions

Great surges of development break with Kondratiev's and Schumpeter's notion of Long Waves

From Perez 1983 finds 3 different types of core industry in the revolution:
* motive - what is cheap (semiconductors, oil, steel, coal, water power)
* carrier - products of the revolution (h/w and s/w, cars and appliances, steel shops, iron machines, textile machines)
* infrastructure - (internet, roads and electricity, world transport, transcontinental railways and steamship routes and ports, national railways and canals)

Discusses the techno-economic or meta- paradigm - emergin heuristic routines and approaches, changes in cost structure. 

Lots of examples from each surge

Also, changes beyond the economy - suburbanisation, globalisation. Discusses organisational changes need to enable flexible networked increasingly global operationsIZ*.  but there is inertia: ``The operations manuals and hierarchical structures of government ministries in the 1960s were fundamentally similar to those of a big mass production corporation. Yet, at present, these two sorts of institutions are very different.''

``On the view being described here, the notions of long run equilibrium and continuous progress are rejected in favour of more complex processes of overcoming multiple disequilibria originated in massive innovation, in internal differentiation within and between sectors, of creative destruction, assimilation, learning and unlearning successive technological spaces and best practice models and of reaching and overcoming maturity through successive surges of change.''

Finds that the mission oriented approach applied to this bank ``constitutes 'fuzzy' policy making which is highly opaque lacking sufficient detail and fails to align itself properly with the demand conditions within the Scottish innovation system''. Suggest some version of diffusion-oriented policies would work better up to include hybrid and generating breakthrough innovation firms.

According to Mazzucato and Penna, state investment banks have three roles: counter-cyclical capital development and new venture support

Is paper asks ``are mission oriented innovation policies sufficiently nuanced to assist policymakers in the operational and strategic deployment of new policy instruments such as the SNIB?''

``Mission-oriented countries often heavily prioritise a highly linear [science and technology approach to innovation] STI view of innovation (Jensen at al 2007)''

Diffusion oriented approach ... ``is more experimental interactive va and relational towards innovation ... knowledge arise from doing, using and interacting (DUI)''

Garudand Karnøe 2003 vividly demonstrate the differences between gui and STI breakthrough approaches towards innovation in their study of Danish and US wind turbine industry. In Denmark there was less emphasis on developing dramatic solutions instead strong networks of actors gradually built up their technological competencies. In us the focus was on producing radically new Hi-Tec lightweight and high-speed turbines. Denmark prevailed.

Identifies that diffusion oriented approaches often have local embeddedness local orientation and this discourages blue skies research and precludes getting involved in the creation of startups.

Considers:
* types of mission
* types of innovation
* types of instruments

Missions:
Goes into some detail pretty king blueprint for the bank identifying that these are rather high-level and don't offer practical mechanism for achieving the objectives. Highlights concerns about the risk of `policy capture', `agency problems', `implementation failures' and the fact that the bank aims to make a positive financial return could mean it becomes risk-averse.

Criticises the advice that policymakers should pick the problem not the sector by saying that ``selecting missions may have unintended consequences of preferentially benefiting certain sectors over others which goes against the banks principal of supporting firms `whatever sector they appear' ''

Innovation:
Identify that much research in Scotland occurs in universities and very little in the SME sector. High-tech SMEs constitute a very small part of the business population. Suggest that the focus on high growth firms could damage the non-high tech SME sector. A note that the unpredictable nature of firm growth some suggest it's random.

Instruments:
Find that there has only been a partial assessment of funding gaps and goes into more detail about funding approaches

According to Haldane (2018, 7) the UK does R well but D poorly where the refers to development that the diffusion and dissemination of innovation. 

The diffusion oriented approach they suggest is is similar to a strategy undertaken by countries such as Israel via their Yozma Fund.

  abstract         = {The traditional “one size fits all” education system has been largely criticized in recent years on the ground of its lacking the capacity to meet individual student needs. Global education systems are leaning towards a more personalized, student-centered approach. Innovations like Big Data, Machine Learning, and Artificial Intelligence (AI) have given the modern-day technology to accommodate the distinctive features of human beings - smart machines and computers have been built to understand individual-specific needs. This opens an avenue for “personalization” in the education sector. From, mushrooming of Education Technology (EdTech) start-ups to government funding in AI research, it is evident that the next generation educational reforms would take a quantum leap forward piloted by Big Data analysis and AI. The objective of this paper is to organize the vast literature on the use of AI for personalization of education and to shed light on the key themes by which an AI-driven approach makes structural modifications to the existing education system. To this effect, the paper employed a systematic review using a Human-In-The-Loop natural language processing model of past two years' literature (2019-2021) in English language from IEEE Xplore on countries China, India and the USA. This process yielded more than 2000 search results at first and these were eventually shortlisted to 353 relevant papers for in-depth analysis. Being the pioneers in EdTech innovations, insights from research done in these three countries provides valuable input for the development of global education systems and research. The findings bring forward AI's success in catering to specific learning requirements, learning habits, and learning abilities of students and guiding them into optimized learning paths across all three countries. Not just that, it is also evident from the literature that AI augments educational content, customizes it for any individual according to their needs, and raises the flag of caution for anticipated learning difficulties. This recalibrates the role of instructors as well as optimizes the teaching-learning environment for a better learning experience. The upward trajectory of educational development with AI opens a new horizon of personalized education for the future generation, but also comes with its challenges. Data privacy issues, availability of digital resources, and affordability constraints have been reported in the recent literature as impediments in the way of promoting such technologies for day-to-day practice.},

  abstract         = {The Circular Economy concept aims to ensure environmental sustainability through the recovery of durable products that have reached the end of their useable life. Recovery strategies such as remanufacturing enable durable parts and cores to be restored to their original functionality and performance, thereby minimising the consumption of virgin materials and energy required for the production of new parts and components. To date, the repair and restoration processes concerning those parts and cores that can be remanufactured involved conventional methods such as material overlay and welding. These conventional methods are highly dependent on skilled manual labour or specialised industrial robots. With the notable growth in the global remanufacturing industry, it is imperative to deploy highly-efficient and sustainable methods to automate repair and restoration. Recent trends in remanufacturing repair and restoration indicate an increasing interest in metal additive manufacturing technology. To enhance the additive manufacturing efficiency for automated repair and restoration, it is crucial to optimise the core design. This paper provides a comprehensive and comparative outline of remanufacturing repair and restoration, using both conventional and automated methods. This paper also presents and discusses comprehensive insight into the application of AI-based techniques for design optimisation specific to additive manufacturing repair. Component design optimisation is crucial due to its impact on process efficiency and the life cycle of components. The review indicates that, despite the increasing interest in using additive manufacturing for repair and restoration, reports on the application of AI for design optimisation specific to repair and restoration using additive manufacturing remain limited. Furthermore, there are no established guidelines concerning design for repair and restoration using additive manufacturing. The paper concludes with recommendations for further research and presents a future outlook on AI-based optimisation for component design to facilitate repair and restoration using additive manufacturing. Automation is expected to facilitate the removal of roadblocks specific to process inefficiency and human limitations during conventional repair and restoration in remanufacturing.},

  abstract         = {Forming a reliable judgement of a machine learning (ML) model's appropriateness for an application ecosystem is critical for its responsible use, and requires considering a broad range of factors including harms, benefits, and responsibilities. In practice, however, evaluations of ML models frequently focus on only a narrow range of decontextualized predictive behaviours. We examine the evaluation gaps between the idealized breadth of evaluation concerns and the observed narrow focus of actual evaluations. Through an empirical study of papers from recent high-profile conferences in the Computer Vision and Natural Language Processing communities, we demonstrate a general focus on a handful of evaluation methods. By considering the metrics and test data distributions used in these methods, we draw attention to which properties of models are centered in the field, revealing the properties that are frequently neglected or sidelined during evaluation. By studying these properties, we demonstrate the machine learning discipline's implicit assumption of a range of commitments which have normative impacts; these include commitments to consequentialism, abstractability from context, the quantifiability of impacts, the limited role of model inputs in evaluation, and the equivalence of different failure modes. Shedding light on these assumptions enables us to question their appropriateness for ML system contexts, pointing the way towards more contextualized evaluation methodologies for robustly examining the trustworthiness of ML models.},

  abstract         = {Coproduction is a process through which inputs from individuals who are not “in” the same organization are transformed into goods and services. Two cases are presented — one from Brazil and one from Nigeria — where public officials play a major role. In Brazil, public officials actively encourage a high level of citizen input to the production of urban infrastructure. In Nigeria, public officials discourage citizen contributions to primary education. The third section of the paper provides a brief overview of the theory of coproduction and its relevance for understanding the two cases. The last section addresses the implications of coproduction in polycentric systems for synergy and development.},
  comment          = {``Coproduction implies that citizens can play an active role in producing public goods and services of consequence to them''

Example from Brazil whereby citizens were involved in digging and installing small feeder lines for water and sanitation which could then be linked into the lrager trunk lines. This meant it could be away from traffic and thus much cheaper and locals could continue to maintain the feeder lines.

Second example was various schools in Nigeria that had a range of states of repair, moral and students outcomes. ``When coproduction is discouraged by taking over schools that villagers had perceived as being ``their'' schools, by creating chaotic changes in who was responsible for funding and running a primary school system, and by top-down administrative command as the style for all decision making, only the most determined citizens will persist in coproductive activities.''},

* The primary government response to England's housing affordability crisis is to build 300,000 new homes per year

* Using embodied and operational emissions models we estimate the government's business-as-usual housing strategy consumes England's whole cumulative carbon budget [1.5°C] by 2050

* Other strategies for meeting society's housing needs are theoretically possible, but they face a challenging political economy

* `Growth-dependencies' in the housing sector mean social welfare risks declining if house prices and construction rates fall

* Solutions include decarbonising the existing housing stock through rapid retrofitting, and policies disincentivising the overconsumption of floorspace


A super snappy summary of the state of housing stock with regard to climate and biodiversity.

``Government household and housing stock data show that the UK has a surplus of dwellings relative to households (Fig. 1). This surplus has grown from 660,000-1.23 million homes from 1996 to 2019 (Mulheirn, 2019)''

``In summary, this exploration of the drivers of housing unaffordability suggests the problem may be less with the total supply of housing units and more with their distribution across the population and `overconsumption' by wealthier groups, enabled by rising incomes and easy credit conditions. Policy reforms that could dampen the demand for housing beyond a basic level of need could theoretically enable the UK housing system to satisfy greater housing need without relying on rapid housing expansion. This is welcome, as a solely supply-side explanation would imply that the only way to satisfy more housing need is through housing expansion, despite the inherent environmental impacts.''},

* Ensure fiscal sustainability. Implement the consolidation plan. Raise the retirement age to improve fiscal
sustainability. Ensure full independence for the recently created Office for Budget Responsibility.
* Reform the regulatory framework for the financial sector. Ensure appropriate regulation and supervision
of the financial system, both through national measures and constructive engagement at the international
and European level. Create a “firewall” between high risk investment banking and commercial banking.
* Improve educational outcomes. Increase participation in quality early-childhood education. Improve
educational outcomes and skill formation, especially among disadvantaged children. Discourage early
leaving from the education system. Increase the quality of vocational training and the availability of
high-quality apprenticeship positions to ensure that relevant skills are provided.
* Increase efforts to make work pay and to help workers to fi nd and retain work. Ensure adequate staffing
of Public Employment Services and target existing activation efforts on the most disadvantaged and
hardest-to-place youth.
* Tackle high levels of disability benefit claimants. Ensure that all claimants are covered by the announced
Work Program scheme. Monitor health status earlier and more frequently in the workforce.
* Pursue public sector reforms to improve productivity. Improve productivity and control costs in health care
by containing capitation fees and wages. Reinforce competition among health care providers to mitigate
price pressures. Raise consistency in the allocation of health care responsibility across government
bodies. Improve productivity in education (e.g. through further decentralisation of decision making).
* Promote green growth. Further enhance integration of environmental concerns into national and sectoral
policies in order to move towards green growth and create incentives for the private sector to invest in
green technologies and undertake climate adaptation actions. Turn the Climate Change Levy into a fullfl edged carbon tax. Abolish the reduced VAT rate for domestic energy use and reassess the economic and
environmental effi ciency of other green taxes.
* Increase the effi ciency of the tax system. Address the economic and environmental ineffi ciencies in the
VAT system created by exemptions and reduced rates.
* Prioritise investment in innovation, infrastructure and R\&D. While fiscal consolidation makes severe
budget cuts necessary, growth enhancing activities such as infrastructure, green investment and R\&D
spending should be prioritised. Implement a national road pricing scheme to mitigate road congestion.
* Improve the functioning of the housing market. Make the planning system more flexible, more predictable
and provide incentives for local communities to release land for building, while continuing to protect
the environment. Shift property taxation from stamp duties towards recurrent taxes based on market
property values.},

Begins with the example of Physikalisch-Technische Reichsanstalt PTR established in Germany in 1887 for developing physical standards using funding, land and organisational design by Werner Siemens. Aim to build up scientific bureaucracy - blueprint of how to move from agile and start-up phase to more stable delivery-focus. 

Siemens is a `bureaucracy hacker'

Appointed a charismatic leader

Mission Mystique (term coined by Charles Goodsell in 2010) enables the innovation bureaucracy to cope with the risks and uncertainties associated with innovaiton and lead dynamic changes

Such innovation bureaucracies are established to deal with emerging technological or socio-economic challanges. This was predicted by Max Weber who described how charismatic authority becomes bureaucratic authority and then back to charismatic. Particular categories of organisation - charismatic networks and expert organisations - is often an oscillation between these extremes: agile stability

Looks at two present-day examples

Vinnova, Swedish Innovation Agency, working now being reframed from focusing primarily on technological issues to tackling socio-economic challenges such as rethinking food systems to privde healthy sustainable food in schools.

Agencies that have been sources of policy innovation have tended to be peripheral agencies, not central (Weberian) and such agencies experience less political interference. This is possibly the ``Schumpeterian alternative''.

``Kattel, Drechsler and Karo 2019 have shown, first, such `central-decentral' dynamics in state capacity help explain dynamic capabilities on the system level, but not on the organisational level; and second, the dynamics can be explained through Weber's theory of authority, in particular through the interplay between charismatic and legal-rational forms of authority (Kattel, Drechsler and Karo 2019).''

NPM reforms in 1980s opened public sector up to private sector managerial practice - strategeic manager, agile management - as well as focus on short-term efficiencies - based on the measurement of inputs and outputs, benchmarking and governement indicators. Focus was on inefficiences in big machine-like organisations rather than innovative capacities of public sector.

Pollitt and Bouckeart (2011) posit that Neo-Weberian state (NWS, see Bouckeart2022) is emerging - public organisations provide ``public services, and at the same time recognises the need for more citizen engagement in the design and delivery of public services''. Also identify new public governance theories - ``emphasise the importance of the co-creation and co-production of public services''.

Find that this is little work analysing the capacities and capabilities of public sector organisations. Suggest that these can be understood around organisational routines. Hypothesise the there are 3 main types of routine:
* sense-making (e.g. information gathering and processing)
* connecting (e.g. new networks and coalitions)
* shaping (e.g. new directionality for organisation)

Tests the hypothesis against three case studies: UK's Government Digital Service (GDS), the city of Barcelona and Swedish innovation agency Vinnova.

``In all three cases, we can argue that existing sense-making routines limited organisational learning and autonomy at the same time. New leadership and new organisational structures were critical to instil both new epistemological perspectives and to make sure there were rapid learning feedback loops.''

New connecting routines were created in all three cases, such as through `democratising' of innovation.

``In terms of shaping — executing or implementing — new activities, both GDS and Barcelona offer more mature cases as Vinnova's implementation processes are at earlier stages.''

Sources of dynamic capabilities:
1. political leadership
2. managerial leadership (new managers)
3. new organisation

``Such organisations aim to be both dynamic and resilient by design. We can call these Neo-Weberian agencies.''},

I would need to look more widely to understand better. (from Kattel2022: ``Introduced by Pollitt and Bouckaert in 2011, the Neo-Weberian state posits that a new paradigm of the state is emerging in the era of post-New Public Management reforms.'')

Reference earlier work that identifies 4 ideal types: maintain, modernise, marketise and minimise. Find that in realit, states can be hybrids or blends of these. Maintain and modernise combine in NWS. A combination of marketise and minimised is a fit with New Public Management (NPM).

OECD promosed NPM and New Zealand showcased this. However, reform is more than simply "more or less" NPM, there are other types of modernisation such as NWS.

Weber considered the difference between  `community'(Gemeinschaft) to `society' (Gesellschaft). He considered rational spirit of bureaucracy as efficient and powerful. This paper describes the Weberian state model as holding space between bureaucracy, society and business.

Develops the `driver'-space which is defined by different mechanisms: hierachy (H), markets (M) and networks (N). NWS is more about H and some N, and less M. I find Table 1 which describes the Weberian and Neo components of NWS. One of the Neo elements is ``Shift from an internal orientation towards bureaucratic rulefollowing towards an external orientation towards meeting citizens' needs and wishes. The primary route to achieving this is not the employment of market mechanisms (although they may occasionally come in handy), but the creation of a professional culture of quality and service. ''

There's lots of discussion of the three components H, M and N and transition between them.

NPM is more about M and some N, much less H. New Public Governance (NPG) has the bias towards N, some M and not much H.},

Table 1 gives overview of organisation theories that explain organisational change - useful to return to.

This studies tests possible reasons for creating innovation labs (from classical organizational and evolutionary theories): 
* emulation
* individual learning
* old and new structures (competition and conflict)
* external complexity (environment)
* technology
* expertise / legitimacy

Discusses financing, performance measures

i-labs usually built around a particular user-design-led method (e..g human-centred design, friendly hacker). They tend to employ people from a wide range of backgrounds.

Reasons for formation, mainly from interviews with executives:
* support for the role of external complexity and technology
* conflict between old and new organizational structures was not brought up as a specific reason
* internal learning effects were deemed subservient to external changes
* specific know-how and the autonomy of i-labs were deemed essential for the survival of the organizations
* some emulation and fad of labs can be justified as a causal factor
* ``politicians were able to show credible commitment to innovation through the creation of public-sector i-labs''
* the reasons for formation do not necessarily remain relevant to goals and logics later on
* other main activities include coordination with other government bodies

Autonomy in salary-setting and staff evaluation, goal-setting was present in many organisations. i-labs are ``supposed'' to be disruptive. ``exist in turbulent and conflicting environments''. However, they have no authority over other public-sector structures and have limited ability to catalyse and push through public-sector-wide changes.

Argue that:
1. creation of i-labs can be tied to external complexity and technology propositions - tech plays a central role
2. its a bit of a fad after ealier i-labs
3. its supposed to catalyse change but autonomy alone is not enough to challenge existing structures [my comments below on this]
4. i-labs tend to have somewhat higher `mortality' that other public sector organisations
5. have a reliance on external ICT capabilities

[izzy - our experience of research and innovation is that it is difficult to permeate the existing organisation. p1474 of this paper discusses how ``and the lack of supportive culture and authority to routinize new solutions limit the potential of i-labs to enact the change-agent's role'']},

Suggests that Weber was not original in his observation of modern bureaucracies as German Brockhaus encyclopedia of 1819 complains about the use of pens when word of mouth has previously done the work.

Weber's analysis was distinctive in how he identified that it was necessary to bring together qualified officials with a systematized organisation.

Give nice history of bureaucracy from paper-based systems, including search, to IT.

The Weberian concept with in-house operations seemed an inadequate idea by the 1990s when much IT is done by external agencies.

Mintzberg (e.g. Mintzberg1996) characterised some Weberian bureaucracies as `machine bureaucracies'. Within this model, IT services are not core but part of the support services. They may even be out-sourced.

``Machine bureaucracies tend to be the dominant organizational form for the biggest users of civilian government IT at national government level''

``there is unlikely to be a director of IT on the management board''

Shows Hood's categorisation of government roles, each having detector (finding out) and effector (getting done) tools:
* Nodality - government is central to society's information networks
* Authority - make laws and regulation that coerce/enforce
* Treasure - secure the provision of goods and services
* Organisation - delivery of services
* Expertise - accumulation [and application?]  of knowledge

Herbert Simon argued that computers could reshape an organisation in 3 ways:
* creating more accessible organisational `memory'
* more information and more potential to problem-solve in modern societies
* increasing the decision-processing capacity - anticipating web and internet impacts

Nice quote from Rose 1990 about how technology is not just the hardware and software but also ``the inculcation of a form of life, the reshaping of various roles for human practices, the mental techniques required in terms of certain practices of communication, the practices of the self orientated around the mobile telephone, the word processor, the World Wide Web, and so forth.''

`audit explosion' - a growth of internal regulators and the linking of key performance indicators (KPIs) to NPM reorganizations (Power 1994).

IT systems effect on policy:
1. can limit  policy-makers' discretionary action whereas that other constaints can be overcome
2. Work-arounds with IT systems can be time/money/capacity prohibative
3. The costs, complexity, and difficulty of IT investments and renewals tend to grow over time
4. The above have feedback implications for administrators' behaviour
5. This can lead to contracting out IT which means specifying what the service and capability should be, which can be less flexible, as can simply working with contractor rather than in-house

Contractors generally reckoned that by winning a contract they would be able to earn much more by requests for new capacity or specification changes.

The Weberian model seemed partial, almost from the start, because it could not explain many real-world examples (including Britain). 

In many systems, those who enter the civil service are trained (to an elite level) in a range of (often general) skills but not IT - and so machine bureaucracies (unlike welfare state agencies - Mintzberg's Professional bureaucracies) tended to be led by IT illiterate managers.  [Does this reflect Mintzberg1996 - if they've managed something, they can manage anything?]. In US, in contrast, departments were run by relevant specialists - although this also seems to be the case.},

Discusses the relationship between different organisations and people

private v public debate:
* capitalism versus communism
* privatization versus nationalization
* the markets of business versus the controls of government
is limited dichotomy

There are 4 types of organisation:
* privately owned
* publicly owned - should really be called state owned
* cooperatively owned - absence of stock market pressures is important for their ability to take a long-term perspective
* non-owned (aka NGOs but also non-business owned and non-cooperatively owned, NBO and NCO)

Private- and state-owned are similar in that they are controlled by hierachies and can be transformed into each other

Despite discourse of people as `customers' of government, looking at the functions that state performs, people can be 
* customer - fits only a few roles of government (lottery tickets!)
* citizen - use of public, government and state infrastructure
* client - one-sided professional service, what the state provides us
* subject - one-sided, respecting state controls

``Couldn't the current malaise about government really stem from its being too much like business rather than not enough?''

Discusses management - or rather Management

Three assumptions underlie the Management view of management, which collapse when considering what governent agencies have to do:
* activities can be isolated and autonomous - Many government activities are interconnected and cannot be isolated
* performance can be evaluated by objective measures - Many activities are in the public sector precisely because of measurement problems / requires soft judgment
* activities can be managed by professional managers - managers are too often ignorant of the subject of their management.

``management. Such a situation just

breeds cynicism. In mortal fear of not meeting the
holy numbers, managers run around reorganizing constantly, engendering more confusion than clarification.''

Discusses model of managing government
1. Government-as-Machine - countervailing force to corruption, lacks flexibility, still dominant
2. Government-as-Network - interactive and free-flowing, organised around projects
3. Performance-Control - make government more like business, the ideal is the divisional structure that conglomerates in particular have popularized
4. Virtual-Government - best government is no government, superstructure exists to arrange for private organizations to provide public services
5. Normative-Control - Control is rooted in values and beliefs, has been essential but not recognised: service and dedication muted the negative effects of bureaucracy.

Normative model has 5 elements:
* Selection
* Socialisation
* Guidance
* Responsibility
* Judgement

Discuss governing managment

``If people believe that government is bumbling and bureaucratic, then that is what it will be''

Businesses can learn from governments, not just vice versa

``the mistaken belief that those who have managed something can manage anything''

``Private sector values are now pervading all of society''

The institution shapes individuals' preferences - New Instituitionalism

Identifies the elements of administrative traditions:
1. state and society
   * organic - state linked and not particularly distinct from society, reform would alter fundamental nature of state
   * contractarian - state arises from conscious social and political contract, constitution, reformable, e.g anglo-american
2. law versus management
   * legalistic: public administration is for administering public law, virtually Weberian, administrators trained as lawyers  e.g. German and French systems (althought NPM has overlayed managerialist ideas)
   * managerialist: public administration is to get things done, law is the beginning (not the end) for PA, e.g. NPM, UK, NZ
   * senior public servant as policy advisor somewhat cuts across these two conceptions - capacity to draft law but also advise on possible social, economic, political consequences of policy
3. administration and politics
   * some traditions assert that public service should be politically neutral, although it often isn't, government should accept administrators (or quietly move them aside)
   * others see political involvement as acceptible even beneficial, government is expected to appoint its own administrators
   * ``NPM devalues the concept of a career, neutral civil service in favor of a more committed and perhaps temporary service''
4. the career
   * career civil servants, in some cases trained in dedicated educational establishments
   * recruitment into and out of civil service
5. state and society II - the role of social interest in government decision making
   * involvement of societal actors can seen seen as legitimating the state and restraining its autonomy, corporatism is common example
   * societal interests represented by advisory commitees, interest groups, NGOs
   * interest groups undermine the authority of the state
   * government fosters support from interest groups
6. uniformity - in policy and administration
   * create uniformity across the nation e.g. France; French, Belgian, Portungese direct rule over colonies
   * recognise differences across the nation e.g. German federal system; British idirect rule over India
   * equality versus self-determination
   * more co-ordinated federalism may result in greater uniformity
7. accountability
   * controls enforced by political actors and legislature versus accountability is primarily internal action
   * accountability enforced after action, or action requires approval
   * perception of corruption leading to NPM (but some NPM reforms have reduced accountability)

Uses these variable to define 4 traditions in Westerrn administration:
* Anglo-American - (some US divergence)
* Germanic
* Napoleonic
* Scandinavian

- Variation within traditions
- Dilution in former colonies
- Netherlands, and to some extent Belgium, combine Germnaic with Napoleonic
- Finland is Scandinavian but with some elements remaining from Russian, whilst this was overlaid on Swedish
- Czech Republic, Slovakia, Hungary recent Russian and earlier Germanic from Austro-Hungarian Empire
- Japan Germanic and Napoleonic from late 19th Century, with Indigenous and Anglo-American from constitution from after WWII
- Tradition in countries can also be reduced to even finer divisions
- There are other administration traditions in the world: Islamic, Confucian, Latin American and African},

Core Values of Agile
1. Individuals and interactions over processes and tools
2. Working software over comprehensive documentation
3.Customer collaboration over contract negotiation
4. Responding to change over following a plan

12 Principles of Agile
1. Seek to fulfill the customer's needs. Do so through the early delivery of software. Continuously improve that software.
2. Respond to the demand for changes to that software because doing so better positions the customer for success.
3. Shorten the timescale for the delivery of working software. Deliver changes frequently.
4. Developers should work hand in hand with business users.
5. Center fabrication around individuals motivated to succeed.
6. Emphasize face-to-face conversation within the team and between the development team and the broader organization.
7. The most important benchmarks are working software.
8. Sustainable development is the goal. All involved parties should be able to maintain a constant pace of engagement.
9. Continuously focus on technical quality and good design.
10. Emphasize simplicity.
11. Self-organization in teams improves design and production.
12. Regularly reflect on how to improve this process.

4 values and 12 principles establish a feedback loop

``Agile projects have four times more successes and one-third fewer failures than waterfall projects (SerradorP2015; Standish Group 2015)''

``agile emphasizes bottom-up change over top-down direction (or even
outside-in from vendors or consultants)''

``Agile Is Antithetical to Many Typical Bureaucratic Line Organizations...managers who need to take responsibility for actions may not be willing to do so given how cross-functional agile teams work ... If experimentation is not part of the toolbox, and if bureaus value organizational reputation and avoid public failures, agile never gains traction ... in organizations largely characterized by “we have seen this before, let's wait until the next wave comes in,” traditionalists could see agile as another fad that will be replaced''},

  comment          = {Loads of examples of how administrative burden can be used to enact policies, sometimes in a convert manner, for public good or sometimes bad.

Examples include voter registration, polling stations, food stamps, health insurance, abortion, tax credits, old age benefits, social security,

``focus on the costs that people encounter when they search for information about public services (learning costs), comply with rules and requirements (compliance costs), and experience the stresses, loss of autonomy, or stigma that come from such encounters (psychological costs)''

``Individuals care as much or more about the process of their interactions with the state as they do about the outcome''

Burdens can be a policy instrument which thwart people's access - could be easier for gov to do than legislature required for more visible policymaking.

``Higher voter participation tends to increase the share of low-income voters, resulting in more generous welfare services, greater equality, more progressive taxation, and less restrictive welfare participation rules. If policymakers and administrators use their authority to influence who votes in elections, they are also influencing the policies that will be adopted after the election, and the burdens that accompany those policies''

Some policies create their own industries which can then lobby for the extention of the policy - e.g. tax credits in US, the tax preparation service lobbied not only for the expansion of the policy but also to maintain enough documentation requirements to ensure tax credit remains
burdensome enough that low-income workers seek professional tax preparation help

``Shifting burdens away from citizens requires a well-functioning administrative state''

``Republicans figured out how to build a politics of burdens that Democrats have been unable or unwilling to develop. Republicans have done so despite the fact that in other areas—such as the regulation of businesses, campaign donations, or firearms—they have also been successful in opposing governmentally imposed burdens in the name of liberty''

Although numerous authors have pointed to the advantages of Agile, with its emphasis on individuals and interactions over processes, customer collaboration over contracts and formal negotiations, and responsiveness over rigid planning, there are, to date, very few large-scale, empirical studies to support the contention that Agile methods can improve the likelihood of project success. Developed originally for software development, it is still predominantly an IT phenomenon. But due to its success it has now spread to non-IT projects. Using a data sample of 1002 projects across multiple industries and countries, we tested the effect of Agile use in organizations on two dimensions of project success: efficiency and overall stakeholder satisfaction against organizational goals. We further examined the moderating effects of variables such as perceived quality of the vision/goals of the project, project complexity, and project team experience. Our findings suggest that Agile methods do have a positive impact on both dimensions of project success. Further, the quality of the vision/goals is a marginally significant moderator of this effect. Implications of these findings and directions for future research are discussed.},

* Leadership and purpose, capturing strategy and values
* Governance and process, capturing decision-making and internal reporting
* People and capabilities, capturing skills and capacity within the department, sector and supply chain
* Organisational structure, capturing the way the organisation is set-up and individuals and teams interact within it.

Overarching conclusions:
1. The Net Zero Target Operating Model attributes are likely to be relevant across all public sector organisations.
2. Whilst the attributes are relevant to all organisations, they will look different for different organisations.
3. Typically, stronger leadership at a more senior level promotes greater commitment across the organisation to support decarbonisation delivery.
4. Developing a high-level strategy which can be communicated across the organisation sets a clear statement of intent, however, a strategy should be backed up with detailed scaled delivery plans.
5. Linking decarbonisation to organisational values makes explicit its importance to departmental operations.
6. Incorporating carbon evaluation metrics into operational process, including business case development and approval, and other decision-making, will unlock and support scaled delivery of decarbonisation.
7. Enhancing existing information reporting systems with energy, cost and carbon related data will empower stakeholders through better and more timely knowledge.
8. Capacity needs to be built for scale and in the right places in the organisation, through mapping of the needs and requirements in each area of the organisation. Skills needs will vary dependent on the type of activity that each actor is going to fulfil.
9. If capacity is not available within the organisation then it should be sought from the supply chain, though care should be taken to ensure that consistent and high-quality support is obtained. Capacity will be needed to support delivery, from installation to onsite security escorting contractors.
10. Improving general carbon literacy throughout the public sector will support better buy-in, wider adoption, and scaled decarbonisation. 11. Having a clearly defined Net Zero organisational structure, that complements the overall organisational structure, will provide clarity to those across the organisation on roles and responsibilities. Attributing clear targets and goals to each group will support delivery.
12. A high-level Net Zero strategy and its underlying delivery plans must consider how all the Net Zero Target Operating Model attributes will be fulfilled, to support decarbonisation at scale in line with relevant targets. This may mean a step change in current deployment plans.
13. Trials and tests of technologies, process and decision-making, and different commercial routes must continue, but be more joined up. Knowledge from trials should be captured and shared more widely to help demonstrate scaled delivery models.
Recording standard information for sharing amongst a community either within a sector or more widely would help others understand how they can deploy at scale.
Departments and other public sector organisations need a committed multi-year budget to be able to start to deliver at scale.
15. Clear direction on expectations for departments and other public sector organisations would support the development of scaled decarbonisation plans.
16. More guidance and collaboration across Government, to support shared learning and speed of uptake efficiently.},

Book is about reconceiving the role of the CIO.

Brilliant, easy to follow, book attempting to identify the role of the CIO in an Agile organisation. CIOs cannot get a 'seat at the table' (in the c-suite) without proving that IT is of strategic value. Books on Agile do not acknowledge the CIO and books on being a CIO do not acknowledge Agile. Currently, IT is considered something that costs and needs control, a plan, etc which works against Agile practise.

Notes that immediate cultural change is ``strangely non-Agile'' p13

There's always conflict: pleasing the customer does not always mean strategic goals are being met or it could mean that the senior management cannot understand what is happening. Sometimes its just that the CIO feels excluded. p14

Scope creep: changes that the business stakeholders request when they realize that a system won’t actually meet their needs as specified ... but which might make it difficult for IT to show that it is delivering on schedule p30 this incentivises getting the requirements perfect from the outset and feature bloat p52 ``a requirement is a constraint masquerading as a decision'' p105 ``Scope doesn't creep, understanding grows'' (Patton) p108

Jean-Paul Sartre, an early Agilist - consciousness chooses at any given instant what it is p83

Section 7 on enterprise architecture EA, how the organisation's capabilities, logics and operation are implemented - this should be in-house because no two organisations are the same and so off the shelf will require too much tweaking anyway.

Governance process is passive, saying no, judgemental process, its like a reality TV show. p175-6

Some kind of oversight is always desired so they came up with an Agile governence and oversight modelhelp interface with expectations of waterfall style organisation, including:
- investment decision and oversight process form a seamless continuum - initiative informs governance decision
- progress gauged by operational results
- boundaries set for planning, don't waste time on too much planning
- decisions made on high-level objectives, not detailed requirements
- transparent, trusted processes for turning business objectives into product parameters
- optimise the whole - EA, people and data

Mission arrived at after first identifying angles - intervention or leverage points. In this case, `streets' was the angle and the mission was devised around this

Demonstrators were then built and installed to gain feedback 

Took away parking spaces, the aim was to reimagine those spaces so that citizens value rather than oppose the change

Surveyed 322 people and 70\% were positive

``if the mission does not receive high-level political or private-sector buy-in and is therefore not integrated into existing structures, then it is unlikely to survive.''

``Vinnova could tap into those existing funding structures, operational environments and capabilities, and work with them to reorient them towards new `north stars'''


``Instead of getting top-level buy-in from the start, the agency focused on developing momentum before bringing its ideas to the national level''

``While representatives of the public sector, industry and communities can help frame the mission at the start, citizen participation is most valuable when testing downstream applications in localised contexts, with genuine decision-making and even co-ownership in play''},

Starts with idea of evolutionary economics but identifies that dynamic capabilities cannot sit within this theory -  this is more Schumpeterian and also has roots in behaviour theory of the firm

About dynamic capabilities - something that entrepreneurs have - that embraces discontinuous change

Largely about manangers, assumes they are source of culture and change in organisation. Sense is of hierachical organisations [IMO even the entrepreneurial ones]

Managers and entrepreneurs are different

``I believe the dynamic capabilities framework can serve as a vehicle for clarifying the relationship between routines and innovation''

``Organisations need routines to get the day-to-day work done. They economise on bounded rationality. The dynamic capabilities framework recognises routines as the very essence of operational (ordinary) capabilities''

(Irritatingly) talks about the `exceptional talents' of `great innovators and integrators such as Henry Ford ... Elon Musk' which seems to assume a predisposition rather than fortune of these people

However, discussion of an ``entrepreneurial state of mind'' and ``entrepreneurial decision-making'' and how these lead to dynamic capabilities

`ordinary capabilities' == `first-order capabilities' (Winter) == `metaroutines' - include industry best practice and incremental changes
These are bought or imitated by rival and so are unlikely to give rise to competitive advantage

Instead, `Teecian dynamic capabilities' which are characteristics that reside on the top management, organisational culture and structure and drive strategic activities. Winter may have described this as ad hoc problem solving and improviation but Teece notes that it may suggest a `quasi-routine for how an entrepreneurially-led organisation solves problems'. Entrepreneurial decision-making is a hybrid of routine and ad hoc approaches.

Schumpeter's entrepreneur: leader  ... new techniques ... new comminations. Everyone has the skills to some degree.

Urban see Musk as innovator using first principles as building blocks combined with experience and instinct

Winter sees innovation as requiring ``talented cooks'' who first imagine the dish, based on understanding of the ingredients/conditions and then iterate over attempted solutions: ``there is not simple answer to the question of where knowledge comes from''

``there are creative and insight-dependent components that cannot be routinised''

Contrasts 2 roles of managers: operational, entrepreneurial and leadership and tables the responsibilities, activities, levers and goals of each.

Entrepreneurship is not adaptation but making of ``new combinations''

``Tenacity, unwavering self-confidence, optimism and a tolerance for stress [iz: and privilege] are traits of successful entrepreneurs

The entrepreneurial state of mind, scanning/sensing and open communication channels should be encouraged through the organisation
Entrepreneurial managers sense, seize, orchestrate, invest in R\&D, develop new business models and seek competitive advantage

``Evolutionary innovations are generally modelled along a single dimension (usually technology) in which change occurs, when in fact there are many ways in which organisations can change, including their internal structure, organisational boundaries, business models, market positioning''. Also time

Organisation change in anticipation of environmental change - but entrepreneurs also shape the environment

``wild orchestration''

``Dynamic capabilities of the public sector are higher-order bundles of political, policy and organizational routines and managerial decisions that drive the strategic activities of public organisations in regimes of deep uncertainty and wicked challenges''},

4 things are required for a digital transformation: a crisis, a political leader,  a team and a mission.

``... a crisis is almost always an essential condition for digitally transforming a government and there's no shortage of them challenges choosing the right crisis''

``Megaprojects and the eye-popping budget overruns are often a good source of crisis material 9 out of 10 government projects with an initial budget of at least £1 billion end up spending more than originally planned''

``Before a country can really begin its journey of digital transformation it needs to find ... groups of engaged people''

``your first digital team will define the working culture and how things are done''

Also covers:
* Design principles
* Starting small
* Release fast, iteratively
* Roles with the team
* Clean structure and working patterns
* Culture
* Performance metrics
* Platforms

``Agile is a rejection of applying for certainty to delivering policy with technology''

``many innovation teams find themselves trapped in the purgatory of being an add on to the day to day rather than a force charged with fundamentally reshaping the organisation''

``innovation teams are destined to always run one step ahead of the rest of the organisation and incentivised to help everyone catch up with them how can you be innovative if everyone is doing the same as you?''

``arguably by having shown that things could be done differently they have done their job whether or not the business brothers to put the theory into practice''

``to have a chance of success a digital mandate must make it possible to stop poorly conceived usually expensive and long IT contracts from being let''

Gather evidence

``there is a real advantage to keeping your strategic ambitions ambiguous as long as possible''

``the digital strategy must act as a signal towards the operating model you want your whole organisation to adopt and the culture that will allow that to happen successfully''

Set the right expectation if you don't know what to under promise and over deliver
However
Making your first draught strategy ambitious gives you more chips to bargain with later

In government there's a paternalistic view that the user doesn't know what they need it's a bit of an excuse they need a public service that is simple and clear enough for them to complete it accurately and quickly so they can get on with their day. Intuitively know they need to have certain qualities.

Creating new rules and standards allows you to scale practise across an organisation quickly

``Change is physically and mentally draining the conflict it brings especially so. Digital transformation of any large organisation is tiring partly because it is about loss''

``we're unconvinced that organisations are unable to provide their employees with a reliable system for filing their travel expenses should be better in the house on nailing the implications of artificial intelligence''

``direction a government chooses to take with AI is as much a political choice that as it is a technological one that is so far removed from the old paperwork as to feel like an entirely separate conversation''},

Both the global financial crisis and the emergence of of Southeast and East Asian tiger States have challenged Western PA.

Western pa has many forms New Public Management, NPM-plus, Weberianism, New Public Governance, Public Value, Weberian-plus, Neo-Weberian State.

Construct a model to demonstrate where good PA falls. This there are three possible forms of good PA. Small nucleus the almost always works anywhere. A larger core that is generally valid. A third level where solutions work well well within a given paradigm but not necessarily outside of this and us these solutions are not easily transferred.

Details Confucian PA and the various forms and origins of this. Particular aspects of Confucian PA are:
* Imperial civil service exam
* Perpetually reforming and adapting PA
* Concept of Mandate of Heaven (by which failure would indicate the mandate has been lost and the public servants would tose their job) which incentivises strong performance as well as as a desire to innovate

``Ethics policies have been largely scandal- not value-driven''

Accountability - system of external control - compliance approach
Ethics - system is internal control - integrity approach

Ethically good also defined in terms of law obedience, impartiality and standardisation

Weberian approach has an ethic of neutrality but this is unrealistic and too narrow in today's multilevel governance

There are codes of rules and regulations which set clear expectations

There are codes of ethics, such as UK Committee on Standards in Public Life 7 principles: selflessness, integrity, objectivity, accountability, openness, honesty and leadership. They are not statutory, there are few guidelines and they cannot be enforced.

There are codes of conduct - aspirational and expectation values. May be seen as transforming princioles of ethics into practice.

Increased public and media scrutiny leads to more scandals and failure often attributed to not enough law. There is a trend towards more rules and monitoring.

Could these ethics policies impact administrative procedures? There is also little understanding of the nature of growing number of specialised ethics bodies.  

The trends in ethics literature:
Focus on scandals and failures of public officials and resulting decreased levels of trust
Consideration of whether there is now too much it too little ethics rules
Broadening and diversification if the whole discussion

You still not much clarity on what works to support ethical practise.  Also focus on rules etc. and less on the impact (or costs and benefits) of policies on behaviours etc.

Higher prestige positions attract offers of board memberships in companies and organisations - rules and standards may be appropriate in this case

Strict transparency requirements do not automatically improve public trust. More ethical rules may cause even more cynicism and have not resulted to a rise in public confidence in government.

Argues that approach to integrity in government must advance beyond the "bad person" model and look at social psychology of organisational life and the capacity of individuals and leaders understand be critical of their own behaviour.

There is conflicting evidence and explanations of how NPM has contributed to increased or decreased integrity. 

Ethically behaviour in the workplace is influenced by:
Individual characteristics
Moral issue characteristics
Organisational characteristics

Discusses the possible impact of the financial crisis on ethical motivations and behaviour in the workplace assumption that result would be negative but there are are also some reasons for positive behavioural outcomes.

Different authors identify different types of accountability e.g. hierarchical, legal, professional, political, direct democratic, bureaucratic

Highly penetrating scrutiny (highlighting crises in finance, environment etc) from increasing range of media subjects government officials to irony that, with so many more means to deliver public goods, it is more difficult to satisfy demands for accountability

Discusses impact of NPM - it removed rules so as to give freedom to act but resulted in at least equivalent transaction costs in performance review, legalistic procedures

Harmon's paradox, which I understand to be the conduct that can occur between the (objective responsibility) of accountability to mandated goals and the (subjective responsibility) accountability as a moral agent. The argument that someone cannot be held responsible for consequences of following one's orders was rejected by the Nuremberg Trials.

With so many scrutiny instruments such as legislative processes and committees, constitutional / statutory requirements, official information and privacy enactments, ombudsman, auditing and media watch dogs, politicians maybe more likely to be sanctioned less for failing to achieve than for failing to do so correctly

A business, like all organisms, needs to continuously adapt to changes in order to survive and if we could somehow describe this then maybe that would give us a map?

Throughout our history, it has always been standardisation of components that has enabled creations of greater complexity

The desire to differentiate creates the novel, the desire to keep up with others makes it commonplace

The map has an anchor which is the user

Each component needs the component below it, however the higher up the map a component is then the more visible it becomes to the user. The lower it is then the less visible it becomes.

There is a flow of risk, information and money between components

Stages of evolution:
- genesis
- custom built
- product (including rental)
- commodity (including utility)

the x-axis of evolution shows the terms for activities alone

A single node on one map can be an entire map from another person’s perspective. Equally, the entire map of your business might be a single component for someone else.},

He proposed seven principles of GaaP: openness, simplicity, participation, `learning from hackers', data mining, experimentation and `leading by example'. This paper looks at Estonia and identifies that it meets the first (except it learns `by example') and does less well on the final three. It's argue that they have focused on the service now and less in the future service. UK seems to be a bit the opposite by embracing experimentation, days mining and a `hacking' culture but struggles with openness, simplicity and participation.

Lots of detail in the Estonian case and quite a bit on UK.

These systems are being increasingly used in many domains, including in humanitarian response, but their behaviours are often not understood in their entirety''.

``risks and harms include: 
- questions of biases and fairness which can oppress minority voices
- accountability of systems and the lack of legal frameworks
- challenges surrounding transparency and human oversight
- a lack of expertise in the proper and appropriate deployment and use of AI
- data privacy and protection concerns; and the meaningful participation of affected communities in every stage of the AI lifecycle, as well as their ownership over such systems''

``drive to draft AI ethical guidelines, frameworks, and training materials at the international, national, and sector specific levels''

1. ``development of frameworks for building and testing multi-AI systems, as well as for understanding emergent behaviours of such systems is essential''
  - mapping the network of information flows
  - stresss tests for systems
2. ``cross-pollination of these technical communities with legal, ethics, and humanitarian response experts''
  - systematic mapping exercise to understand the potential gaps in existing ethical principles and guidelines
  - adapt current risk and harms assessments
3. communicate these concepts to project managers and decision-makers
  - operational guidelines
  - capacity building exercises
  - communities of practice

Key concepts:
1. Cultural capacities as adaptations: Culture, cultural transmission, and cultural evolution arise from genetically evolved psychological adaptations for acquiring ideas, beliefs, values, practices, mental models, and strategies
2. Cultural evolution: These cognitive adaptations give rise to a robust second system of inheritance that operates by different transmission rules than genetic inheritance, and can thus produce phenomena not observed in other less cultural species
3. Culture-gene coevolution: The second system of inheritance created by cultural evolution can alter both the social and physical environments faced by evolving genes

This is a huge transformation

Options were to 
- implement current (1980s) approach, now called ``shock therapy'' - overnight liberalisation of prices, or 
- dual track reform - planned and market track - produce to meet the plan and then have the option to produce for the market

  comment          = {This paper seeks to illuminate this processof developmental initiatives, shifting attention from policy programs to the processes that generate them and specifically analyse  the  experience of reform-minded policymakers in Finland and Israel

Argues:
-  `Schumpeterian development agencies' (SDAs), public organizations with a mandate to facilitate innovation in new industries, played a critical role in precipitating industrial adjustment
- these agencies occupied a _peripheral_ position in the public sector where limited access to resources exposed these agencies to new ideas and limited political interference

1. concept of the Schumpeterian development agency
2. policy-makers in small states introduced STI programmes and faced scling and monitoring of policies with exposure to domestic networks and international competition
3. policy-makers relied on agencies and instruments, and these relied on inter-personal networks and international competition to scale and monitor developmental projects

Washington concensus seeked to identify a best practice that in reality either cannot be applied without translation or does not work in the same way in the unique circumstances of each application

In small states, inter-elite networks mean that policy-makers, industry representatives and other key decision-makers are more likely to know and trust one another. This means projects can be scaled. But its also harder to kill projects. SDAs can find it harder to penetrate these networks. 

Small states tend to be more internationally open which, for several reasons, facilitates monitoring and enables easier adaptation or abandonment of programmes. However, agencies that had STI policies that comply with interestnational regulations are monitored less and find it more difficult to adapt policies particularly during good times.

Finland - Sitra - independant think-tank and SDA. Demand-side innovation policy and investment in easly stage risk. Science (and Technology) Policy Council linked ministers and prime minister and also ran courses on economic policy and the importance of innovation for policy-makers, corp execs, trade union leaders and journalists. Adaptations happened during downturns.

Israel - Office of the Chief Scientist in the Ministry of Trade and Industry (OCS) -  conditionally repayable loans, intensive and repeated meeting with decision makers in private industry, educating them about the value of R&D and infusing them with enthusiasm toward technological innovation

the debate on STI and DUI modes originates in the so-called “innovation paradox” in which the inputs (e.g. R\&D expenditure) are not reflected in the level of innovation and economic output

STI innovation mode supports interactions with centres producing new knowledge – mainly research centres and universities, scientific brokers and foundations for the diffusion of scientific research – which generate the codified and explicit knowledge that can be used by the firm to produce innovations

DUI innovation - in the firm generated by the capacity of the firm to develop informal and formal exchanges internal to the firm, but also interactions with suppliers, customers and competitors

these modes might complement each other in the production of higher outcomes in terms of both innovation and economic performance

This paper studies the Basque Autonomous Community in Spain

``From a policy-making and a business practice perspective, some critical implications may be drawn. In particular, the fact that most businesses adopt a DUI type of interaction does not imply that it is an effective interaction mode. It delivers lower impact (than STI factors) in technological and radical innovation, whereas it matters more for non-technological innovation. And it is inadequate when it is bounded to the regional environment (DUI-regional)''.},

  abstract         = {STI (Science, Technology, and Innovation) and DUI (Doing, Using, and Interacting) are two different types of innovation policies, each with its own focus and objectives.

STI innovation policy emphasizes the importance of scientific research and development, technology advancement, and innovation in driving economic growth and societal progress. STI policies are often associated with funding for research and development, tax incentives for innovation, and the creation of science parks and innovation hubs. The objective of STI policies is to create new technologies, products, and services that can drive economic growth and improve the quality of life for citizens.

Examples of STI innovation policy include the funding of scientific research and development by the National Science Foundation in the United States, the creation of science parks such as the Cambridge Science Park in the UK, and tax incentives for innovation offered by many countries to encourage private sector investment in research and development.

DUI innovation policy, on the other hand, emphasizes the importance of innovation in everyday practices, including doing, using, and interacting. DUI policies focus on the adoption of existing technologies and the development of new practices that can improve productivity, reduce costs, and enhance competitiveness. The objective of DUI policies is to promote innovation at the grassroots level and to encourage the adoption of new practices by firms, organizations, and individuals.

Examples of DUI innovation policy include the provision of training and education to workers to help them adopt new technologies and practices, the promotion of collaborative practices and partnerships between firms, and the development of user-centered design methodologies that involve users in the design of new products and services.

In summary, STI policies focus on the creation of new technologies and innovations through scientific research and development, while DUI policies focus on the adoption of existing technologies and the development of new practices through everyday doing, using, and interacting.},

US society has solved many fundamental but relatively easy problems (clean water, transport, waste disposal, ...). People continue to demand change to the system. The planning system needs to turn to other issues. It needs to define its goals and problems whilst addressing issues of equity.

PPBS - Planning, Programming and Budgeting System - requires statement of desired outcomes (introduced as a response to recognition that incrementalism - tweaking policy rather than determining if it is the correct policy - was not working)

``one of the most intractable problems is that of defining problems ((of knowing what distinguishes an observed condition from a desired condition)'' as well as working out what actions would solve the problem.

Talks about the problem of the idealised planning system and how it actually works - which is constant adjustment and evaluation (Iz - it needs to be agile?). The application of science and engineering approaches to society has not worked.

``Planning problems are inherently wicked'' (not tame or benign) and have at least 10 distinguishing characteristics:
1. There is no definitive formulation of a wicked problem - all the possible solutions are part of the definition of the problem
2. Wicked problems have no stopping rule - solving and understanding are part of the same process which ends when some external criterion is met
3. Solutions to wicked problems are not true-or-false, but good-or-bad - there are many parties whom are equipped, interested and/or entitled to judge
4. There is no immediate and no ultimate test of a solution to a wicked problem - any solution will generate waves of consequences
5. Every solution to a wicked problem is a `one-shot operation'; because there is no opportunity to learn by trial-and-error, every attempt counts significantly 
6. Wicked problems do not have an enumerable (or an exhaustively describable) set of potential solutions, nor is there a well-described set of permissible operations that may be incorporated into the plan
7. Every wicked problem is essentially unique 
8. Every wicked problem can be considered to be a symptom of another problem
9. The existence of a discrepancy representing a wicked problem can be explained in numerous ways. The choice of explanation determines the nature of the problem's resolution
10. The planner has no right to be wrong - a problem statement is not a hypothesis to be refuted and thus planners are liable for the consequences of actions they generate

Small minorities can comprise large numbers of people, the concept of the social product is not very meaningful; possibly there is no aggregate measure for the welfare of a highly diversified society

A paper of its time, with commentary on pluralism and a new awareness of societal ills (inequality, consumption and pollution) and that different groups have different values and cultures.},

  abstract         = {Action on climate change, to meet the targets set in the 2015 Paris Agreement, requires strong political support at the national level. Whilst the political and governance challenges of climate change have been discussed at length, there is little understanding of how politicians, as influential individuals within the political system, understand or respond to climate change. This article presents findings from 14 qualitative interviews with Members of the UK Parliament, to discuss how politicians conceptualise climate change, and their deliberations on whether or how to act on the issue. First, it reviews an interdisciplinary literature from sociology, political theory and science and technology studies, to investigate how politicians navigate their work and life. Second, it presents ‘composite narratives’ to provide four different MPs’ stories. Last, it draws conclusions and implications for practice. It highlights three crucial factors: identity, or how politicians consider the climate issue in the context of their professional identity and the cultural norms of their workplace; representation, how politicians assess their role as a representative, and whether proposed political action on climate is seen as compatible with this representative function; and working practices, how day-to-day work rituals and pressures influence the aims, ambitions and engagement of politicians with climate change.},

Most politicians do understand the need to act on climate change. MPs have three linked considerations:
1. How does climate action fit within their role?
2. What mandate do they have?
3. How to address climate change in day to day realities of political life?

Politicians see climate change as an ``outsider issue'' and tends to mainly be considered in economic terms. Politicians get little push from voters on the issue of climate change and so finding ``representative claims'' for climate action can be difficult. Three representative claims that may be used:
- Cosmopolitan claim - its in the interests of the global community to act
- Local prevention claim - its in the interests of the local community to prevent impacts such as local flooding
- Co-benefits claim - most common includes improving local economies and services by supporting climate action
- Surrogate claim - don't talk about climate but act on it e.g. on sustainable transport

During interviews, interviewees tended to steer the conversation away from climate ``like they don't want to think about [it]''

Created stories for 4 composite polticians:
- The climate champion, willing to speak out even though many constituents do not seem concerned
- The newcomer, cautious and careful to put his constituency first
- The realist, focuses on the tangible and achievable and justifies on social and economic grounds
- The ex-minister, relaxed and willing to speak out

Agenda for action:
- widen the mandate by creating climate reponsibilities in departments and local regions
- involve people, such as with deliberative processes
- devising policies that grow support, such as around energy infrastructure, transport, divestment and a just transition
- consider the long term in institutional changes},

``thinking future is a way of bringing back planning for the future but under a new framing. Issues are now so big and wicked ... coordinate futures ... I suggest that futures thinking is a major way of brining the state and civil society back in from the cold ...''
