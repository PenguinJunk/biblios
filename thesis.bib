1. the scientific community is a political community
2. science plays a role in politics outside the laboratory
3. there is a conditional relationship between the polity of scientists and the wider polity (p. 332). 

Similarly, Latour (2007), Nahuis and Van Lente (2008), and Papadopoulos (2010) each identify five ways that science is political, and Bijker (2006) finds no fewer than seven ways that technology is political''

Discussion of political 
``Posthumanist conceptions of politics help show how science and technology often fail to produce accepted factual knowledge and instead generate contentious `matters of concern', such as mad cow disease or genetically modified food, which become focal points of scientific uncertainty and political controversies (Latour, 2004b)''},

``apparent gap in empirical and theoretical research on attitudes towards technology in general and attitudes of Ecological Economists in particular''

Generally people in Europe are optimistic towards science and technology but there is a trend towards pessimission towards technology, with some fluctuations

From 1980s science literacy was thought to be necessary to address non-positive attitudes towards science and technology (deficit model), with public participation and deliberaton becoming fo tool to repair public trust in 2000s p140

This parallels ecological economics post-normal science positions from 1990s

Find limitations to the use of DT to date. Tonurist suggest this is because labs are small, lack stability or authority. There are also limitations in how well these approaches can scale, like in participatory approaches p125-6

Survey labs in Australia and NZ, so somewhat limited

three approaches to policy (a) logic, (b) foundation and (c) speaking truth to power, table 1:
- Rational - (a) deduction, induction, objectivity, (b) evidence, (c) technical expertise
- Participatory - (a) inclusion, consultation, argumentation, collaboration, (b) discussion, (c) democratic principles
- Design thinking - (a) innovation, humanity, intuition, abduction, (b) imaginaton, (c) creative ideas

Discussion of DT p112
Loosely human-centred
Inspired by the participatory philosophies of theorists such as Papanek and Manzini
Some say it is `bottom-up', narrowing the gap between designers and citizens
Iskander 2018 argues that DT privileges the designer ahead of those who are meant to be served by the process

Paper asks 3 questions:
1. what is really new about DT in the public sector?
2. how does it challenge or differ from more traditional approaches to policymaking?
3. what impact, if any, does it have on the process of policymaking?

and compare DT to rational-process and participatory models

Discussion of PSI Labs - vanguard of DT in public sector, focus of innovation

Policymaking is usually described as rational, sequential with known problems p114 Adams 2004: contemporary movement towards `evidence-based' policymaking is a species of scientism, posits verifiable social-scientific knowledge as the `modern currency of public policy' p116  emphasis on precision and closure p116

Alternatives to rational are interpretative and participatory models p115

``both problem construction and solution analysis is `intimately involved with relations of power' (FischerF1993 p7)

DT is abductive, iterative, p114 situated p116 playful, creative, illogical p115 open and ambiguous p116

```emotion and intuition' are treated as valid bases for determining viable options (Bason, 2013). This marks an important difference with deliberative approaches which, while recognising the importance of empathy in mobilising participants to gain mutual understanding, nevertheless privilege the `inherent rationality' (Renn2006: 35) of
argumentative persuasion as the basis for adjudicating options''

Analyse:
- the methods used by PSI labs (e.g. a few use RCTs, many use citizen/stakeholder engagement through workshops, etc)
- the design levels (e.g. a few engage in developing policy proposals or reforms, many consult with stakeholders)
- stages of the innovation cycle worked at (e.g. a few evaluate programmes/trials/pilots, most generate ideas)},

We claim this approach can maximize the impact of rich idiographic research to enable theory-refining and evidence-building efforts in the field. We illustrate these benefits through reference to a worked example focused on public encounters with social security in advanced liberal democracies. We show how we drew together 49 ethnographic studies from a variety of disciplines to identify repertoires of response that citizens exercise in their encounters with the contemporary welfare state. Through this analysis, we demonstrate how meta-ethnography can shed new light on topical contemporary debates about administrative burden. We conclude by reflecting on the prospects and limits of this technique for broader use in the field.}},
  comment          = {Argues for rich interpretative synthesis over ethnographic work, which is currently ``conceived and practiced as a one-shot (usually “lone wolf”) activity, and is not geared at producing data amenable to reutilization by the wider research community'' for public administration

Benefits of meta-ethnography:
1.  particular tolerance for heterogenous data can link the (often) small numbers of studies in policy and administration to those emerging in a host of cognate disciplines which engage with similar problems and questions
2. exploratory orientation - underpinned by a ``logic of discovery'' - can also elicit powerful new understandings
3. confront the perception that ethnographic research has a short shelf-life and fails to generate an empirical legacy amenable to systematic reutilization
4. keep ethnographic studies relevant even as topical discussions and theoretical debates in the field evolve

``Meta-ethnography entails the creative and generative process of identifying, reading, relating, and translating studies of similar phenomena into one another. It is an approach to synthesizing the insights from published research that shares a commitment to an ``ethnographic sensibility'' and the exploratory orientation underpinned by a ``logic of discovery''''

``It involved uncovering patterns through tracing explicit cross-references and recurring tropes, resonant quotes, and familiar anecdotes across each ``thick description.''''

``It is not painting by numbers, searching by keywords, scanning abstracts for findings, extracting insights free of context''

Noblit and Hare's 7-step framework: 
1. getting started (what we already know, talking to researchers, etc)
2. deciding what is relevant to the initial interest 
3. reading the studies 
4. determining how the studies are related 
5. translating the studies into one another 
6. synthesizing the translation 
7. presenting the synthesis

But conducting a meta-ethnography does not entail a linear or ``stepwise'' approach

However, this paper assesses each step for its strengths, challenges and identifies practical strategies

e.g. drawbacks:
- reading and iterative discovery entails greater investment than typical literature review
- second hand knowledge of the studies is shallower than first-hand experience
- ``meta-ethnography frees interpretive analysts up from concerns about exposing “raw” data, but it does not wash our hands of ethical responsibility for how we choose to identify stories, retell them, and draw out their implications''

Bases a worked example on HerdM2018's work on administrative burden

``Our emphasis was on studies that foregrounded the beliefs and experiences of citizens in their encounters with social security in rich detail''

Abductive process, identified three key dilemmas which link to HrdM2018's costs of learning, complance and psychological costs:
- how to navigate complex rules
- how to avoid sanctions
- how to save face

Found three broad groups of responses ``repertoires'':
- dissent
- dissociation
- personalization

A third essential component of our framework is the ``window of opportunity'' embodying ``specific moments, modes and loci for action'' (Stirling, 2014, p. 7)'' p5

Discuss the different perspectives from different fields (International Relations, IR, and Science and Technology Studies STS) of how close expertise should be to decision making and whether expertise matters. In IR, the neorealist stream regards scientific advice as epiphenomenal and even dismiss the value of scientific advice. Haas writes about epistemic communities and the need to insulate them from political influence in order to matter. Whereas IR constructivist accounts draw attention to how the global problem of climate change was constructed [I guess: by science and policy not being separated?]. STS, with ideas such as boundary work, hybridization and coproduction, resists a separation between expert and policy.

``reject quasi-epiphenomenal, neorealist treatments of expertise ... emphasize that science-policy interfaces are crucial in promoting social learning among policymakers, which is necessary for policy formulation'' p11

``Cash et al. (2003) developed a theoretical framework based on the three pillars of credibility, relevance, and legitimacy (also known as CRELE)'' p3

``knowledge can only matter if it is widely accepted by policymakers'' p4

Dimensions of the framework developed:
- institutional design (deductively derived) - formal rules and procedures
- boundary work (deductively derived) - informal science-policy interplay
- window of opportunity (inductively derived) - that expertise can seize to influence policy-making

UNCCD is a similar, but less well known body, as IPCC and IPBES. It is ``unique in its embeddedness in a political convention'' p5-6

Gives examples of how the interaction in the SPI can help scientists learn how to communicate in ways that are useful p7

Finds that small size of UNCCD and its scientific founding are valuable - easier for more non-governmental voices to be heard. Bring in experts for specific areas as required p8

Also find that state power is counteractive - member states of the global north do not value the UNCCD, some were even manipulating its language p9

Whereas some member states in the global south were staunch supporters p10

Experienced actors with expertise were able to sieze windows of opportunity to make their voices heard p10

``political side will always be the ultimate arbiter''. Not enough attention paid to power dynamics and diverse interests p11

3 broad challenges have emerged from global evaluation practice in relation to its contribution to public policies:
- Establishing what solutions work
- Explaining why solutions work (or not)
- Transferring research findings into policy actions

In terms of causality, there are various stances including:
- successionists - focus on analysing the direct association between a treatment and an observed outcome
- configurationists - pay attention to the attributes that lead to variations in outcomes
- generativists - focus on identifying the supporting factors underlying an observed causal relation

``By the end of the 1970s, the policy research community started to recognise the growing gap between the production of analyses and their incorporation into programme decision-making (Weiss, 1988)'' p94

Reasons for this: p94
- timing - ex-ante evaluations are late in the process
- differences - experts and policy-makers differ in terms of purposes, mindsets and languages
- organisations - they are bureaucratic and absorb information in complex, non-linear ways (punctuated equilibrium)

Categories of issues found in labs: p96
- structures
- functions
- processes

Found that ``labs' ambition to create meaningful change in these two areas [engaging citizens and changing the culture of government] has not been followed by a clear idea of what exact impact they are aiming at, nor a way to measure it'' p99

``policy labs are heavily based on design practice including design thinking and industrial design'' p100

It promises to bring universities and other knowledge organisations into line with new demands and opportunities. In this study, we have investigated drivers of change in the shifting landscape, and note disparate drivers that plot different courses for transdisciplinarity. We describe three drivers: `the knowledge economy', `the environmental imperative' and `the engaged populace'. We discuss their different prescriptions for transdisciplinary knowledge production and contradictions that arise from these, including tensions between consolidation and interconnection, and between knowledge commodification and mutual learning. In response, we suggest that rather than investing in knowledge `products', universities should focus on developing capacity for transdisciplinarity, and for knowledge production generally.},
  comment          = {Argue that commodification of knowledge endagers transdisciplinarity and knowledge production.

The shifting landscape of knowledge production:
- knowledge economy:

Knowledge economy emerging as feature of capitalism. Knowledge is seen as contributing to the economy by reshaping and adding value to existing industries and creating new industries. There is a reconceptualisation of knowledge as a commodity traded with knowledge consumers.

This is reflected in changes to university funding and incentives, ``third role'' to contribute to the economy and generate more funding for themselves and the ``corporatisation of universities'' - research priorities now being reorganized into a few research strengths and priority areas

Australian Cooperative Research Centre CRC is a response - universities with industry research partners

- environmental imperative:
Environmental imperative has seen more consideration of ideas of practice of transdisciplinarity

- engaged populace:
Education and knowledge are more socially distributed with www and higher amount of higher education

calls by Gibbons and co-workers for a shift to Mode 2 knowledge production, which is synonymous with transdisciplinarity]

``The tainting of some of the Mertonian norms of science - disinterestedness and objectivity - by values of the market and by the contingencies of application and past failings of science to adequately address complex and uncertain problems have also lead to challenges to the monopoly authority of science. This loss of authority, which has been described as a ``crisis of public confidence'', creates new opportunities for other sources of knowledge to gain legitimacy. This is supported by movements inside and outside academia challenging the dominance of scientific knowledge and promoting respect for diverse lay and indigenous knowledges. A lack of faith in the power of science to provide all the answers, or even to ask the right questions, has led to increasing demand for the public to be included in decision-making processes and for science to seek a `shared vision' or `contract' with the public'' [worth looking up refs in this section]

Engaged populace is a driver for transdisciplinarity

Where is the place of people in our knowledge?

``there are increasing demands for public participation in knowledge creation and policy deliberations, both from the bottom-up (i.e. from a more educated populace which lacks confidence in science) and from the top-down (i.e. from researchers and government who recognize the value of lay knowledge for decision quality). This translates into the need for an approach to knowledge production that is consultative, deliberative and participatory. This has given rise to the concept of mutual learning'' p464-5

Transdisciplinarity and multidisciplinary are seen as counter to formation of silos. But university consolidation with commercial incentives risks building mega silos. p465

``Transdisciplinarity is a practice that requires flexibility and fluidity. There are several ways in which attempts to institutionalise it may in fact inhibit it'': p466
1. mega-silos replace disciplinary boundaries with topic, technology and industry boundaries
2. institutions that have invested transdisciplinary approaches may be unresponsive to new problems - related to `paradox of density' which finds that innovation in a research area is proportionally greater when the area is new
3.  institutionalisation may detract from a knowledge production approach that provides interconnection, complexity and systems thinking e.g. interconnections between economic, environmental and social dimensions
4. can lead to reprioritisation around commercial agendas

Considers area of plant improvement - see what to commercialisable research but not in publications.

Contradictions and tensions:
- institutionalisation versus interconnection - ``institutionalisation threatening interconnection represents a tension between the `knowledge economy' perspective and the environmental imperative''
- knowledge commodification mutual learning - Commercialisation of knowledge and `resource extraction'
  - problem of power - privileging of particular types of knowledge
  - some scientists driven by knowledge economy and its opportunities, others fear threats to their autonomy

``Differences in intellectual property cultures, between academia and industry, but even more notably between formalised and lay or indigenous knowledge, leave open the prospect of exploitation of knowledge `resources' ''
Commodification of knowledge endagers transdisciplinarity and knowledge production - thus there is a need to build intellectual capacity in universities - . ``Strong intellectual capacity is therefore best served by combining disciplinarity and transdisciplinarity'' p469

Currently university ``culture is characterised by individuality, elitism, the accumulation of advantage (the Matthew effect) and academic territorialism associated with disciplines and specialisations'' p469-70},

key issue of representation: ``who participates and what values, perspectives and interests do these participants represent, and deliberation; how can all voices be voiced and included in a legitimate way''

biases towards elite actors are worrying because they result in these processes reproducing or even exacerbating existing inequalities. Elite actors (e.g. government, large NGOs, or scientists) are able to shape these processes to serve their interests because they:
- have more time and resources available
- often initiate these processes, define the scope for participation
- have more knowledge and skills
- better able to articulate a contribution that is considered relevant and important
- have strong authority that is attributed to scientific expertise vis-a-vis other knowledge systems p16
- often paid to participate as part of their professional roles, while the other participants are expected to volunteer their time
- more often invited to participate than unorganized citizens or less well-known groups

Further:
- inherent Western bias
- ongoing challenges of colonialism
- contexts characterized by conflict, and communities that are not able to self-organize nor given support by local decision-maker

Unequal power is often driven by depoliticisation which enforces norms in knowledge and communication which drives out other political interests, norms and values [- basically not mentioning the political elephant in the room -] Examples include ignore the lobbying effects of powerful interests.

Depoliticisation can be recognised as:
1. projects led by a rationale of science-driven impacts and do not challenge existing hierarchies between scientific and other knowledge holders
2. projects strive for consensus and for solutions that are considered rational according to elite perspectives, but which may cover up fundamental differences among participants in terms of stakes, power, access to resources, vulnerability, and risk
3. co-production stays confined to project boundaries without engaging the wider political context in which these projects are embedded

``co-production as both a knowledge-making and a political practice which is inevitably imbued with unequal power relations that need to be acknowledged but cannot be managed away''

``there are no simple solutions''},

  abstract         = {Nature is perceived and valued in starkly different and often conflicting ways. This paper presents the rationale for the inclusive valuation of nature's contributions to people (NCP) in decision making, as well as broad methodological steps for doing so. While developed within the context of the Intergovernmental Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services (IPBES), this approach is more widely applicable to initiatives at the knowledge-policy interface, which require a pluralistic approach to recognizing the diversity of values. We argue that transformative practices aiming at sustainable futures would benefit from embracing such diversity, which require recognizing and addressing power relationships across stakeholder groups that hold different values on human nature-relations and NCP.},
  comment          = {Nature's Contribution to People (NCP) bridges notions of nature and a good quality of life

Recognises that there are different worldviews and values associated with NCP and present the rationale for an inclusive incorporation of the diversity of values of NCP in decision making

Emphasis in the consideration of diverse values of NCP to inform policies and everyday practices can be placed, for example on:
- food and feed
- protecting the evolutionary processes of biodiversity and the continued functioning of ecosystems
- honouring the Earth as a sacred living being or on maintaining harmonic relationships between people and nature

Contrast unidimensional value framings (e.g. economic, ecological, social, cultural) with pluralistic valuation (diverse world views). This inform the policy toolbox which is thus restricted in the single world view case.

Acknowledging diverse world views would take a social-ecological perspective, where nature, NCP and a good quality of life are seen as interdependent, and would require activating deliberative approaches towards potential conflict resolution over values. It is associated with the need to leverage power relations through participatory negotiation among stakeholders holding incommensurable values over human-nature relations. p11

Propose a 5-step approach to facilitate valuation:
1. identify the purpose
2. scope the process
3. pluralistic visualisation (methods and assessments)
4. integration and bridging - require transdisciplinarity blending expert valuation and social participatory processes
5. communication on value and review the valuation process

2 key principles:
1. valuation and value assessments require the recognition of a broad range of worldviews
2. valuation requires learning that the incorporation of values and valuation methods into decision making processes are themselves value-laden},

``The NCP framework is also careful not to prioritize scientific knowledge on ecological functions and economic values over diverse knowledges, worldviews, and values, as the previous iterations of the ES framework tended to do (Martín-López et al.2014). With the adoption of the concept of NCP, IPBES thus stresses the need of science-policy interfaces to advance the legitimate inclusion of diverse knowledge systems in assessments and planning, to achieve well-being, conservation, and sustainable use'' (PascualEtAl2018) p95

Challenges to the integration of ILK: p96
1. ``tendency of scientists to consider science as superior to ILK (Agrawal1995)'', leads to: 
  - resist making shared decisions with IPLC
  - extract decontextualised knowledge from ILK
2. ``disciplinary backgrounds make it difficult to establish common knowledge about the various social-ecological interplays that make  up and affect biodiversity (Carpenter et al.2009)''
3. ``ES and NCP frameworks tend to emphasize how humans depend on and benefit from nature, that is, NCP (Kenter2018; Peterson et al.2018) and focus less on PCN''

Conceptualisation in `Western' science that there are universal and value-neutral truths and that material and non-material phenomena should be addressed separately  reproduces two dichotomies: p96
- between scientific knowledge and ILK systems
- between social and natural science disciplines

critique of ecosystem services and why NCP emerged p97
but also that NCP gives limited space for the role of people shaping nature, especially the practices that fall beyond different knowledges and worldviews p99

``Post-structuralist, post-humanist, and post-colonial schools of thought ... argue that reality is multiple and that it can be understood by `pluriverses' of knowledge (Escobar2016, p. 13)'' p96

Discourses have 3 elements of meaning (Foucault): p96
- classification systems - categories that reflect items that people values and identify with
- values - qualifications that people use to signify phenomena and guide action
- aspirations - ideal images associated with needs and objectives and people and policies prioritize

This work uses the discourses of planner and indigenous actor groups to identify the resonances and incongruences between their classification systems, values, and aspirations. Data was publications, reports, legal descriptions and interviews with policy-makers and (non) governmental planners involved in an ES policy and processes implementation (SISA) 40 Kaxinaw\'as of varied ages and gender who participated in the local SISA assessment and planning p100

``In the interviews, we probed both planners and Kaxinaw\'as on their aspirations, values, and classification systems and we asked them how they perceived the participatory processes to implement SISA and how they were able to influence the inclusion of knowledge and worldviews'' using circles of dialogue (Freire 2000), participatory mapping (Albuquerque et al. 2014)  p100

[Thus this is participatory analysis of a participatory process]

``analyzed how discourses shaped assessment and planning processes by contrasting how different interview respondents and participants in the workshop reported about the extent to which they were able to influence the participatory processes and its outcomes. This enabled us to identify whether and how knowledge differences present in different discourses influenced power dynamics and affected the inclusion of diverse and relational knowledge and worldviews'' p101

Results are detailed - differences in discourses but observation that SISA discourse moves closer to that on Kaxinaw\'a in terms of non-material and material contributions that people provide to nature respectively via their knowledge, values, aspirations, and their practices. p110

In terms of the participatory processes, soil science planners retained power in deciding when Kaxinaw\'a and social scientists were involved, by judging what was relevant to them -> reduction of the diversity of knowledges and worldviews in the outcomes  p110

and more generally: ``while SISA outcomes were overall considered legitimate by Kaxinaw\'as ... a stronger voice of locals to shape processes could have resulted in a more comprehensive representation of diverse knowledges and worldviews, as well as in an enhanced legitimacy, validity, and relevance of policy outcomes'' p110

In terms of frameworks, find that PCN is still not sufficiently accounted for in NCP and ES

``Our study suggests thus that the legitimacy and effectiveness of environmental assessment and planning can be improved when actors on the science-policy interface facilitate participation  and engagement that gives voice to participants who hold different knowledge systems and disciplines, that focuses on common objectives, aspirations, and priorities which account for both people and ecosystems' roles, and that connects assessment to planning and practice'' p111},

``Scientists can play different roles, e.g. knowledge generators, the arbiter of knowledge generation or advocating for a particular cause, such as reducing consumption (Crouzat et al. Citation2018). The common departure point of these stances is often one of academic superiority and belief in the credibility, legitimacy, and relevance of scientific knowledge over other knowledges (for an in-depth discussion on this, see Sala and Torchio 2019). Alternatively, scientists can play a key role building bridges between a range of knowledges and co-producing solutions towards sustainability (NorstromEtAl2020)'' p349

Steven Shapin and Simon Schaffer, Leviathan and the Air Pump, looks at how science is undertaken and identify how there is a strong social aspect

The line of work led to science studies and also to looking at scientific controversies (as they would have been in their day) to consider how they were resolved 

Boyle designed the air-pump to experiment with how air is necessary to life. Before that there was natural philosophy - what people observed - and arts (what we'd call engineering) - Boyle's work brough both together. He also invited in witnesses and wrote up the experiments in a manner that made the reader much like a witness. Hobbes disagreed with this approach and didn't believe that just seeing the experiment was enough to compel people to agree. This fight was largely hidden from history.

From the 80s-90s - ``science wars'' - Schaffer and others accused of constructivism by challenging the ideas of how science occurred. They identified that scientists should be neither deified [my word] or considered completely ordinary.

The phrase ``public understanding of science'' is intrinsically ambiguous

- ethical challenges associated with bio-hybrid robotics are discussed

Questions arise around:
- integrity of life
- status and rights of semi-living beings
- potential long-term impacts on natural ecosystems
- unknown unknowns

Four different schools of relevant ethics:
- consequentialism - consequence - produces the best available consequences (e.g. on balance, utilitarian)
- deontologism - universal rule - actions should be guided by universal applicaton of moral principles
- virtue ethics - prudence (phronesis) - a virtuous person would take such action
- ethics of responsibility - responsibility - aka environmental ethics

Categorise the ethical issues of bio-hybrid robots into:
- interactivity
- integrability (assimilation)
- ontological and moral status (e.g. as a living thing or if consciousness is developed)

Describe 3 scenarios arising from bio-hybrid technologies and outline their benefits, disbenefits and questions to be asked about these. From this, a series of ``critical questions'' around each of the ethics schools of thought by which 6 necessities of the framework are identified (which are like instructions for anyone engaged in work around bio-hybrid robotics).

The section on policy strategies:
- regulation necessary but may be controversial - call for stakeholder participation in in this
- research ethics governance is necessary but not sufficient - again general public should be involved in deliberation which would also support knowledge transfer, other options include mandatory ethical impact assessments

Mention the `yuck factor' or `wisdom of repugnance' which may help guide what is acceptible - again if public is involved early

And why settled beliefs become controvesial again - answers include new technologies changing the way we percieve the world - which leads to new disciplines

Climate science and genomics [and AI] arose out of new technologies changing the way we see the world

And why different settings have different settled v controversy perspectives (and expert v normative dimensions) on the same topics (law and politics can have very distinct framings)

MSA is ``antidote to the biggest work of fiction in policy studies: rational policymaking during a policy cycle''

Policymaking is only a little rational - there are irrational aspects that enable the selection from too much information on both problems and solutions. Policy entrepreneurs are both problem- and knowledge-brokers

Entrepreneurs have 3 strategies to maximise their impact:
1. tell a good story about the policy problem - combining evidence and emotional appeals - agenda setting is about exercising power to generate attention (framing reduces ambiguity) and producing high-quality evidence (reducing uncertainty) - example of tobacco control
2. have a solution ready to chase a problem - ideas are chameleon-like, adapting to new environment - timing matters
3. `surf the waves' or try to move the sea - venue shop and venue shift, pre-soften solutions, emulate Poseiden, identify when MSA does not apply - how to adapt their environment to exploit or create windows of opportunity},

Cognitive dissonance theory predicted, and evidence from experimentation demonstrated, that attitudes are derived from action (not the presumed other way around). p3-4

Agency, `knowing how to act in order to bring about an intended effect', is also important and social learning is key to this

Self-persuasion can be negative or positive. When positive, action inspires action and agency and efficacy are deepened p4

More domains of agency need to be developed through communities of practice. Currently climate agency is only observed in: p5
- acting on one's personal carbon footprint
- climate activism

Education-entertainment and positive deviance, used within health domains, offer ways of generated these effects (agency, attitude from behaviour, self-persuasion). To this end a story structure is outlined that has agency at its heart. The team are working with screenwriters on these approaches.

Great for literature on these different aspects as well as the overall framework

Attributes (can be nurtured):
- ambition
- social acuity
- credibility
- sociability
- tenacity

Skills (can be learned):
- strategic thinking
- team building
- collecting evidence
- making arguments
- engagement multiple audiences
- negotiating
- networking

Strategies (depend on attributes and skills):
- problem framing
- using and expanding networks
- working with advocacy coalitions
- leading by example
- scaling up changes processes

``while the literature on policy entrepreneurship often places the focus on specific individuals, how they collaborate with others is always fundamental to explaining the development and promotion of policy innovations (see Huitema, Lebel, and Meijerink  2011); Mintrom and Thomas  2018). Some contributors to this literature have suggested that organizations, such as the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, can serve as policy entrepreneurs''

``Framing problems in new ways can improve chances of building winning coalitions''

Framing tactics:
- presenting evidence to suggest a crisis is at hand
- highlighting failures of current policy settings
- drawing support of actors beyond immediate problem scope

Meaning is constructed through discussion with others in order to establish persuasive frames

Potentially very useful case study: Ken Livingstone framed climate change as an urban issue and ``showed other city leaders how to assert themselves as central players on climate change policy'' leading to the C40 network of cities [modelling action as in De Meyer] he also built links across cities [collaboration across silos?]},

Highly quantitative study finding that anti-HVHF with higher centrality (more links into network) were more influential (for pro-HVHF, the degree centrality did not seem to have an effect). Pro-HVHF are advantaged by having higher power connections such as ``insider'' political actors. Cohesion (degree of connected across the network - the ratio of actual to possible triads) affects the anti-HVHF position, with less cohesion leading to more success. For both groups (some caution advised with anti-HVHF) having connections to larger coalitions who are sympathetic to their cause is influential.

Describes the courses of the problem, policy and politics streams and how the Big Ask emerged and was developed, tactics used by the FOE team (draft bill, publicity, coalition building, lobbying by constituents, scaling up to Europe - although this was less successful)

Also helped by political conditions - party leaders vying to have environmental credentials

``as the window of opportunity for change opened in the problem and politics streams, FoE made a radical *policy* solution, the Climate Change Bill, available to policymakers (see also Lorenzoni and Benson)''

``The Big Ask was not particularly innovative'' but the less successful previous legislation ideas provided lessons [pre-softened]

``qualitative methodology using public documentary sources, internal FoE reports on the campaign, interviews with members of FoE campaign team and material from a wider set of around 20 interviews with key actors closely involved in climate policymaking circles during the period 2006--2008''

ENGOs are usually at the mercy of `issue attention cycles'' (Downs 1972) - challenge is to exploit these

Nice history of climate activity in UK - e.g. personal interview with David King

Big Ask idea emerged in late 2004 at FoE offices with Bryony Worthington (then FoE climate campaigner) and Martyn Williams (then FoE parliamentary campaigner)

``Worthington made the case for a top-down approach, setting overall targets and then working out policies to reach the targets'' [this and other examples of action rather than issue communications]

``In February 2005, FoE met other ENGOs to seek support for the idea and the campaign. WWF and the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds took a 'wait and see' position; Greenpeace rejected the idea (although later it supported it). So FoE decided to proceed alone''},

personal standards of moral behaviour serve a self-regulatory role

In the practical implications they outline the means by which bureaucratic structures of organisations may be enablers of moral disengagement

Bandura (1986) suggested that moral self-regulation can be deactivated or disengaged via 8 mechanisms:
- moral justification
- euphemistic labeling
- advantageous comparison
- displacement of responsibility
- diffusion of responsibility
- disregarding or distorting the consequences
- dehumanization
- attribution of blame

Hypothesise that moral disengagement is related to:
- empathy (negatively) - disposition view of empathy, some individuals are more vicarious empathetic
- trait cynicism (positively) - a philosophy of human nature developed through early experience related to frustration with and distrust of others
- locus of control orientations (positively related to chance external local of control and power external local of control, negatively related to internal local of control) - where individuals percieve control on outcomes lies (luck, powerful others, their own behaviour, etc)

Interview participants in the process of creating policy around a coastal protection/enhancement scheme in the Netherlands. The actors begin either happy with the current scheme (don't see any problem) or are keen to implement an innovative solution (they have a solution in mind).

IPA is abductive and links interpretative policy analysis [IPA] with the MSF [MSA] (they cite two other papers that have attempted this).

Discuss they framing interaction mechanisms are used. IPE characteristics (based on other works):
- sense-making
- defining problems in others' terms
- building epistemic communities
- willing to take risks (not strictly interpretative)

This interactional framing involves actor making meaning together (rather than alone or for but not with others). ``Frame-convergent framing moves bring about reframing among other actors, thereby increasing the epistemic community''. Other framings have negative outcomes. Framing interactions (from Dewulf and Bouwen 2012):
- incorporation - include watered-down version of other frame
- accommodation - include near-exact copy of other frame
- reconnection - overcoming conflict
- disconnection - worsening conflict
- polarisation 

``convinced other actors that issues on different levels and in different sectors could be solved by using the same policy solution''

Actors had different interpretations of the problem ``the Sand Motor case represents a `frame conflict' between actors, such as the provincial government, who expect the Sand Motor to be a promising technology and actors, such as the public works agency, who feel there is no need for experimentation when lives are at stake and the technology in place works''

From interviews, constructed timelines and identified when participants perceived change in theirs or others' framings, when interactions occurred. From these determined what type of framing interactions occurred. From this they identify an individual IPE. Note a ``gradual opening up of most actors'' [Cairney's softening?]

Interesting to note that one party did not engage at the start because they did not perceive a problem - this needed other actors to reframe to solve the frame conflict. Also that polarisation was used by one group to gain power by building support - this led to a top-down order for the the other group to comply.},

Bring together concepts of boundary organisation (BO) with policy entrepreneur (PE) and problem broker (PB) from and multiple streams analysis (MSA)

Argue that KBOs can act as BOs, PEs and PBs

My summary of their findings is that bringing the PE and PB aspects into the model permits better understanding of the more political and/or subjective aspects of the KBO (e.g. see tensions below) but it does not explain how tensions are reconciled.

Note a conflict [my word] in KBO's roles between providing `objective' [their quotes] evidence and determining what counts as evidence
Tensions: 
- objectivity versus finding common ground, making recommendations, influencing and steering
- evidence versus ideas - depends on the KBO
- credible versus selective evidence
- in the politics - tend not to address question sof interests, agendas and alliances in the policy process and yet are pulled into this is various ways (by proximity to, dependance on, government)

Credibility is built in different ways:
- BOs - established by balancing the needs and values of both worlds
- PEs, and to some extent PBs, assist decision-makers by helping them privilege particular ('credible') framings of policy problems and solutions

KBOs are highly diverse but have 3 characteristics:
1. evidence and evidence-informed policymaking is central to their work
2. tend to use the tools and practices of knowledge-brokering
3. close links to government due to funding

BOs:
- involve participation of players from different worlds e.g. research and policy
- produce boundary objects e.g. evidence reviews
- principle-agent relationships with each side of boundary e.g. can be principle of commissioned research and agent contracted by governement

literature on BOs is often more on their aims than their actions

``KBOs ... position themselves as neither official nor interest based and therefore trustworthy''

``multiple coexisting boundaries between research, policy, and practice that KBOs bridge: epistemic, professional, and organisational''

Interviews are with 85 politicians from France, Denmark, Germany, UK and US, a range of polticial parties, some who've never been in government. Diverse perspectives are identified, largely along political lines. Also ``triangulated'' with politicians' advisors. Particularly interesting for the method - detailed in the appendix

Did not intruduce environment/climate into interview until late (if at all - it was not introduced for early interviews) to give a sense of how much these topics were considered to relate to the overt topic of economics.

Chapter 1 Do we need more economic experts?

Situates the book in the timing of COP26, noticing how many financial advisors to governments attended - awareness that climate has a strong financial/economic aspect. Introduces the suggestion by some for a new technocracy - previously right wing politicians have called for some aspects of the state to be ``depoliticised'' and passed on to relevant experts, privatised utilities - now there's a progressive call to use experts to advise on the climate and other crises. This could suit politicians who can blame others if it doesn't pan out.

Chapter 2 Politicians' respect for economists

Broad patterns within the interviews. Far-right parties resisted being interviewed. Economic goals are often expressed in a moralistic way - distributive justice and growth, so that people have the things they want. Analysed which economists were mentioned (elicited by indirect questions such as how useful they found exonomists) and found a quarter barely mentioned any. Questioned about economists objectivity - those with centre-right thinking about neoclassical mainstream economists were more likely that others to say they think they are objective and accepted economists as scientists to a degree. But more were sceptical about economists' objectivity. Many do not seem to respect the specialised knowledge of economists - finding them too technical or their advice impractical. Also politicians believe if is their own responsibliity to make decisions, some with advice from economists and other experts. Those economists/schools most respected are Keynes and Liberals, followed by Marx/Hayek/Free Market, then Adam Smith/Friedman/Council of economic advisors. Give a top-20 21st century economists positively cited (includes Behaviourl economists, Piketty, Rawaroth, Krugman, Mazzucato).

Chapter 8 Politicians and climate change economists

Given the results and what the interviewees said, what place economics expertise in tackling the climate emergency? Having not directly questioned about this, at least at the start, an indication about how much climate mattered could be gauged. Divergent ideas falling into 3 categories:
1. threat from climate change as only marginally affecting their economic ideas, either because they think the threat is not severe or because they think they can deal with it within their existing market-based economic paradigms, adaptation such as insurance is more valued than mitigation which may cause the economy to ``suffer''
2. modified their responses to a greater extent - a very large group that spans different approaches
3. environmentalism should become the basis for economic thinking - believing in ``socio-ecological restructuring''

far-left politicians who argue for radical environmentalist and social economic policies are divided into Marxist ``productivist'' (often embraced by trade unionists) and a more ``post-work'' orientation and opt for ``de-growth''

Sense the politicians have changed their perspectives a great deal, but environment is still ``tacked onto how they always thought about the economy'' this may not be so for future generations of politicians.

Discussion of how voters may not understand economic ideas, how heterodox left ideas are far from economic visions of self-interest voters,

In particular this considers:
- Michael Crichton's 2004 State of Fear, a fictional commentary of mis-use of science ``facts'', in this case to make people belief climate change is worse than it really is
- Naomi Oresks and Eric M. Conway's 2010 Merchants of Doubt, a non-fictional account of how science has been misused to undermine scientific consensus

The lens is STS, in particular the fall-out from the ``science wars'' of the 1990s [descirbed in Jasanoff2019] and arguments around objectivity, particularly the argument for summetry, all of which emerged out of works of Kuhn and of Fleck who discussed fact-making as a social enterprise. Arguments that expertise, credibility, situatedness and power are all part of this discussion [also CayleyS2009]

State of Fear came after 2004's The Day After Tomorrow which was a not-terribly accurate fictional portrayal of the consequences of climate change that had been shown to increase levels of public concern about global warming

In 2014, Oreske and Conway created a fictional response, The Collapse of Western Civilisation: A View From the Future, intended to be more science-based

Criticism of scientists for using fear to generate a response - emotions are not objective
Others hail these works as bold efforts for getting to grips with fact
Interestingly the opposite responses to the accounts are given by the same parties (e.g. positive about Oreske and Conway, negative about Crichton)

Latour had argued that STS and allied academics need to ``shift from a precoccupation with mere matters of fact to matters of concern'' - Crichton rejected this - Latour was concerned that the ``tools of deconstruction ... had begun to be weaponized'' [i.e. used to undermine scientific concensus, leading to science wars]},

Understood meanings differ between people, but they cluster into groups

Emotion plays a role in shaping how a concept is represented, particularly more abstract concepts, and this can be tied to your identity

Climate scientists and economists have very different conceptualisations of ``risk'' and ``uncertainty'', due to different practices

economist - uncertainty is like doubt, risk is calculable

climate scientist - risk is a negative consequence

``Physical scientists are usually most concerned with avoiding false positives results from their work .. erring on the side of least drama''

[other epistemic domains (e.g. medicine, economics) are false-negative error-avoidant]

No overlap among the groups

``People intolerant of uncertainty ``have this separation in semantic representations at a neural level ... which helps you disambiguate concepts, thereby reducing some of the uncertainty that's all around us.'' The researchers call this ``semantic expansion.''''

``developed a scale called the self-censorship orientation (SCO) with the assumption that those who support the use of self-censorship are also more likely to practice it''

clarify the general value of a free flow of information:
- freedom of expression
- full and free access to information - public interest and societal welbeing
- the right to be informed
- unrestrained flow of information may also be harmful
- some social/cultural contexts encourage self-censorship

provide a definition of self-censorship and discusses its nature:
- ``intentionally and voluntarily withholding information from others in the absence of formal obstacles''
- sociopsychological mechanism, along with conformity and obedience
- in some contexts its akin to conformity, if one perceives that one's opinion is not shared and so does not express it
- consider the definition to include that this is new information for the context
- but limit it to information, not opinion (i.e. thoughts, ideas, beliefs, or value judgments)

SC may occur due to:
1. negative implications for the individual
2. negative implications for other specific individuals
3. negative implications for the ingroup
4. negative implications for a valued belief
5. implications for a third party

Self-censor may be
- gatekeeper v ordinary person
- people possessing first-hand v second-hand information
- witholding unequivocal truthful information v information of questionable validity

describe the psychological bases of self-censorship:
- given ``the need to share'', it is assumed that self-censorship has a serious motive
- identifying with a group can lead to witholding information that may harm the group
- revealing information may violate some principle, even if the information is socially relevant

introduce the underlying motivational basis of self-censorship and differentiates self-censorship from two sociopsychological concepts: conformity and obedience. Motivations to:
- protect the ingroup
- avoid external negative sanctions and gain positive rewards (personal) (to avoid damaged reputation, delegitimization, and being ostracized, or concrete punishment such as dismissal, imprisonment, and even physical violence; to gain social approval, awards or concrete rewards, and even self-satisfaction)
- protect self-image
- protect a belief
- protect a third party

Go into detail about research into self-censorship regarding Isreali-Palestinian conflict

antecedents and consequences of self-censorhsip:
- armed confrontation significantly increases support for self-censorship in comparison to times of relative calm
- personal characteristics (e.g., authoritarianism, ethnocentrism, siege mentality) predicted support for self-censorship
- double standards - support SC within their own context but not in other societies},

- organizational control e.g. needing to seek permission for interviews and op-eds
- control between rival academics e.g. derogation of younger researchers
- control from the publics e.g. researchers not talking publicly about their work due to fear of harrassment 

There are varying amounts of work into:
- political and economic control
- mutual silencing or suppression between researchers
- aggressive feedback from ordinary citizens and the lay public that is intended to intimidate scientists

In Finland, ``academic capitalism and the commodification of academic research (e.g., Hackett 1990) have shaped academic organizations and academic work so that ``(s)cientists' alienation, dissatisfaction with research, and eroding conditions of employment'' (Hackett 2014, 635) have become major concerns''

Interesting for methodology of identify [best practice] solutions and seeing if decision-makers use these and, if not, why not. From this understand what mechanisms limit the way decision-makers use expertise

Identified theoretical explanations for actions of planners and then searched for evidence statements for these (in documents and interviews) and used these to critically discuss if the explanation was relevant in the concrete case

For each case study, drew out the elements in the plan and used literature to determine if it would have affect of reducing or increasing traffic volumes

Looked at the mechanisms through which expert knowledge may introduced were important to each case study, and how they contribute to achieving the goal

Also identified counter-productive mechanisms (e.g. not introducing a traffic reduction objective)

Find that planners use expert knowledge to argue for co-ordinating land-use and transport planning, and for certain strategies, but still use measure that reduce their potential to achieve their goal. Propose 4 explanations for this:
1. The ways planners gain knowledge affects how they use or ignore expert knowledge when making plans [informal and non-compulsory ways of learning about state-of-the-art]
2. The ways planners use or ignore expert knowledge when making plans -- their practice -- cause that counter-productive measures are included in plans - this is a lot about framing an culture
3. Characteristics of the expert knowledge cause planners either not to use it or to use it wrongly - knowledge is not available in precise and unquestionable answers, ``asymmetric buden of evidence'', difficult to identify the most authoratative source
4. The distribution and exertion of power in planning processes prevents planners from using the expert knowledge when making plans - Lukes2005 and BachrachBaratz1962

Recommend that planning professionals (as a body):
1. make their main objective high on the agenda
2. find ways of solving challenge and meeting conflicting objectives
3. use documented and research-based knowledge when this becomes difficult
4. be more critical of own ideas
5. present clear descriptions of cause-effect relations
6. know and exercise their power as knowledge carriers

Recommend that planning researchers:
- produce evidence that strengthens the expert knowledge of planners
- contribute with relevant articles in popular science journals, and in seminars, conferences and courses directed towards practitioners, and to planning debates
- produce summaries relevant to planning practice
- seek out knowledge about what is relevant to planning practice


Planners act based on their:
- objectives
- expert knowledge
- powers

which affects the objectives that are made prominent and the knowledge that is applied - which affects whether plans achieve objectives

- Developing land-use as urban densification close to city centres, as `car-independent' location of new activities, and with daily services within walking distance of residential areas (density, centrality, accessibility)
- Improving public transport services (frequency, coverage, speed, comfort, prices) and conditions for walking and cycling (infrastructure, maintenance, land-use)
- Imposing physical and fiscal restrictions on road traffic (road tolls, road capacity reductions, reduced access to parking or increased parking prices)''

Great for references of studies considering what influences e.g. car use (such as increased road capacity increases car use), urban structure

``A main impression from readings published over recent decades, however, is that planning theory *does not* deal much with expert knowledge on concrete issues planning deals with, the role of such knowledge in planning processes and how it affects the content of plans''

Amazing file of open-ended responses which could be an interesting data set:

from the data file: ``we can work on climate change issues again. Under Trump I was told I couldn't give a public webinar if I didn't change my title to exclude climate change and I couldn't say climate change. I had to say ``global change''''

from the data file: ``Scientific integrity requires open and vigorous debate of differing opinions. This is being limited due to the zero harassments policy and the requirement that people be collegial. Scientists are filing harassments charges (EPA 4711) against each other for differences in scientific opinion. We have entered into a dangerous place of self-censorship and decisions being made using incomplete information.''

from the data file: ``There is an embedded pattern of top down control and self censorship that is independent of the administration. There is a list of 30+ controversial topics and research on these topics must be reviewed by National Program staff before publication. I believe that this list goes further back than the Obama administration.''

from the data file: ``perception of left-wing bias can cause CDC's scientific findings to be dismissed ... self-censorship (much like academia) on issues the Progressive left won't tolerate''

  comment          = {Reflects much of what is found in ValiverronenS2021 regarding how research and researchers are constrained by funding, funders, and others, in this case in the climate space - there is over emphasis on negative emissions technologies when there is little evidence for their efficacy in the required timescales. Decision-makers not receiving this knowledge on lack of evidence because funding calls do not permit that knowledge to surface - actively suppress it.

``It is a source of immense frustration to us that senior and influential members of the climate community have frequently expressed off-the-record views about the implications of current `best science' that they will not say in public''

In IPCC's 5th assessment report, ``net zero'' is mentioned 23 times, mainly in relation to proven technologies such as Passivhaus buildings. In the 6th assessment report, ``net zero'' is mentioned 963 times, overwhelmingly in the context of speculative negative emissions and carbon capture technologies.

There is a ``mitigation-deterrent'' effect of allowing these technologies to do the heavy-lifting

``At the tricky interface between science and policy, the freedom to `speak truth to power' is essential for an honest representation of the science to be delivered. Sadly, such freedom is not offered on a plate by inherently conservative (with a small `c') governments and civil service departments. Funded calls for research typically exclude inquiry into policy responses unlikely to align with the incumbent economic paradigm. Moreover, research outcomes that don't support the paradigm seldom, if ever, achieve policy impact ... within these narrow ideological constraints that supposedly impartial academic researchers are expected to forge their careers by securing grant funding. Good luck getting funding for research that questions the groupthink, or even for work that isn't obviously corroborative of it''},

IPCC has internalised the logic of future discounting and deployment of ``carbon unicorns'' p36

Baseline scenario is continuing with existing trends - leaving out impacts of climate for instance p40 - and an imperative of gradualism p42

IPCC models based on orthodox economics and assume fully functioning markets and competitive market behaviour - thus largely ignore transformation by mass behavioural change or government non-market interventions (because these are less cost-efficient) p36-7

Thus, negative emissions technologies fit the ``commitment to the ideology of mainstream economics, a narrow reliance on cost-effectiveness as the most appropriate way to mediate between alternative climate futures''

It may be that it is possible to massively reduce emissions without negative emissions technologies, probably at much greater cost financially p44 but also maybe politically (although what politically realistic mitigation options are there?) p45

Issues around the creation of knowledge becoming political - modellers are just creating scenarios but these become prescriptive - the dominant discourse creates constraints on science: p38
- problems are articulated in a way that is compatible with prevailing political and economic logics
- solutions proposed within these logics
- thus knowledge production reflects existing power relations

``value-laden and contestable assumptions appear as somehow unavoidable or ``natural,''which closes opportunities for debate and the involvement of dissenting voices''

``many of the scenarios that explicitly exclude CCS (including BECCS) are unable to generate 2°C-compatible pathways at all because of prohibitively high costs''},

Faster progress with the same level of political will and social will and resources

The science:

Is essential - we need this to know about climate change

However research that is done and communicated is in the form of forecasting - Sharpe argues for more risk assessment

forecasting is - what will happen and do we care?
risk assessment is - what is the worst that could happen to what we care about and then how likely is that? e.g. what are our limits to tolerance

Science culture of risk is very averse to false positives unlike insurance or defence who are very averse to false negatives

Suggest risk assessment exercises in each country brining together risk experts and climate scientists. 

The economics:

There are irreducable uncertainties and inherent subjectivity (e.g. about what we care about) and so economists cannot reasonably put numbers on the economics of the problem
They can put numbers on the economics of the solution

Economics assumes equilibrium which is fundamentally flawed, particularly in a rapidly changing world - constant change, uncertainty, complex dynamics

If you think of system in equilibrium, you tax existing systems. If you assume it is dynamic, you invest in new approaches. Analogy is move from horse to car - we didn't do it by putting a tax on horse manure

The diplomacy:

diplomacy has a number of approaches that could be used:
- scale - don't negotiate everything all at once, break down the sectors and negotiate these separately
- participation - don't try to get everyone in the room, bring in enough to influence the rest
- timing - don't create targets well into the future when governments are very uncertain [and largely don't care] but work on near term objectives and changes may be greater than anticipated},

For the most part, however, environmental scientists have taken on these extra duties because they believed it was the right thing to do and despite the considerable impediments that exist within academia. But make no mistake, the culture of academia continues to impede progress. As a result, although the above actions have had demonstrable effect, their collective impact falls far short of what is needed if society is to tackle effectively the disruption underway due to climate change, ocean acidification, biodiversity loss, pandemics, and more. Actions by individuals can take us only so far. To truly help society meet its grand challenges, environmental scientists must now make a quantum leap in engagement with society. It is time for strategic, collective action to change the culture of academia and create the enabling conditions for science to serve society better.},

Moment of truth, all hands on deck, social contract, etc

In that article Lubchenco identifies that too much vital science knowledge, e.g. on environmental problems, is hidden in publications and not enough is exposed to the public or policy as knowledge and for scrutiny - science is not delivering on its social contract

``Many scientists do not appreciate that numerous factors beyond scientific information influence the decisions made by both institutions and individuals''

``science is not at the table because it is not accessible, understandable, or seen as relevant, or credible''

Story about VP Biden being surprised that he understood the science as she explained it

A lot has changed in the 22 years
- much more science communication, e.g. social media
- more use-inspired science (tackling big, wicked problems and producing knowledge that can be immediatly helpful)
- engaging with society beyond simply communicating 
- co-creating solutions beyond simply diagnosing problems

But this has been insufficient because they have been individual efforts - academic culture does not value or reward scientists who do these things. Collective action is needed, which entails:
1. dialogue about engagement as a core responsibility
2. incentivising these engagements
3. training, mentoring, etc on engagement, conflict resolution, negotiation, systems thinking, teamwork
4. building partnerships e.g. between university and local community
5. create communities of practice about engagement and scalable solutions
6. funding is requred for these changes to be effective

Q\&A hosted by Rapley follows asking about:
- barriers to large institutions making such changes
- reductionism v holistic approach
- engaging young scientists
- incentives},

Three arguments:
1. social knowledge (which is evolutionary) needs the interaction between study and making of policy - neither can make a superior claim on it
2. both the why (scholars) and the how (policy) of social knowledge are necessary
3. both have political commitments to pursue their task which are different and complementary

Different understandings of truth:
- Objective - mainly the domain of academic world since policy world manipulates truth for political ends - but objective understanding is ambitious, self-serving and demeans policy-making
- Subjective (relative) - or intersubjective in that it is (socially) constructed by epistemic community, contingent and relative (critical or historic school, Kuhn), social context even for physical sciences, constructivist especially social science
- Evolutionary - embedded in history and unfolds as history progresses (Marx), very much in the social realm as patterns are created by individuals and society and observed as such

Continues as if the last - evolutionary - is the case - and thus both scholarship and policy-making share the quest for truth

Of scholars and policy-makers, both believe they cannot bend to the other

``The science of global warming, for example, cannot dictate policy outcomes, because all knowledge is uncertain especially when it deals with creative human beings, democracies depend on persuading majorities, and no practical system has resources to cover all risks''

``Too many scholars forget the uncertainties of their knowledge and speak too glibly about truth'' (cites and quotes from Weber)

Finishes by challenging political bias which is often ignored. Quotes Bull 1972: ``a danger less easy to recognise \[than where scholarly values have been subordinated to political ones\] is the case where scholarly values are observed, and indeed great intellectual rigour may be displayed, yet within a moral and political framework that is left unquestioned.''},

  comment          = {Based on a review of the literature on knowledge brokerage - starts from the current state of science advice and then goes into great detail about knowledge brokerage could and should be

First gives overview of science advice to policy which was originally the role of entrusted government administrator but became more sophisticated first through scientific institutes, science advisors and even multi-lateral organisations such as IPCC and IPBES. The role of science advice now falls to ecosystems of organisations and individuals but based on linear-rational model.

Policy is founded on a plurality of knowledge

Jasanoff and Wynne 1998 suggest that enhanced scientific knowledge rarely resolves policy conflicts

Cairney 2016 and Jasanoff 1994 identify that linear conceptualisation is not reflected in the real world

Values are always embedded in knowledge production

Posit two functions that need to be filled at science-policy interface:
- evidence synthesis - e.g. meta-analysis, model construction [codification?], needs to be unbiased, multi-discipline
- knowledge brokerage - inspired by Pielke2007's Honest Broker:
  - issues advocate - can advance policy although sometimes misrepresent consensus if experts who operate outside their domains and especially are paid to create doubt (e.g. Oreskes and Conway, 2010)
  - honest broker - assist policymakers to make choices between options, provide clarity of evidence

Pielke later implied the ``stealth advocate''

Brokerage must be underpinned by:
- core principles of trust, transparency and legitimacy
- respect for diverse knowledge systems
- acknowledging values and biases

Goes on to give more detail about brokerage organisations and who can perform this role

Also ``public-facing evidence brokerage'' (science communicator?)

Recommendations for effective brokerage:
1. consider the demand (policy) side and policy dynamics of the issue [Bisbal2024 cites McNie2007 for this]
2. recognise the policy question, purpose and evidence need
3. think about the framing - is the right question being asked?
4. assess the evidence base (quantity and quality of available evidence)
5. assess the knowledge gaps
6. communicate the uncertainties, caveats and reliability of evidence
7. identify constraints on scientific claims - inferential gap between knowledge and conclusions
8. evaluate the level of `consensus'
10. ensure comprehension in the presentational approach - it must be useful to the policymaker},

- Honest broker of policy alternatives - contributes expertise to decision-making (in co-production)

Foundation is Lubchenco speech of 1997 [discussed in LubchencoR2020] and also using The Honest Broker from Roger Pielke Jr. (Pielke2007 all but science communicator)

``fundamentally, there is a lack of a formal mechanism by which climate scientists can discuss these issues or receive training for roles that are additional to their scientific research''

Note that objectivity is achieved in science by the scrutiny of hostile cooperation of scientists (Popper)

Personalised storytelling is valuable to the communicator (Corner and Groves, 2014)

Some see impartiality compromised by issue advocate role, others ``argue that a climate scientist's specialist knowledge, acquired at the taxpayers' expense, constitutes an obligation to speak out''

  comment          = {Constructivist approach to understanding boundary work as an endeavour within multiple levels in society. This ultimately explains why boundary organisations are not a ``silver bullet'' because their success depends on:
- the (inter)national political culture regarding the status and role of science in policymaking
- the culture of the policy domain
- the characteristics of the policy problem itself
- the role of the relevant boundary organization and its activities
- the framing of the policy problem (defines the need for science)
- path dependency is also evident from how the organisation was set up

`` it is not possible to formulate definitive prescriptions or `best practice' on boundary organizations or boundary work'' - but it seems difficult for boundary organisations to give up this goal

academic endeavours have three interwoven elements: 
- descriptive (“what is actually happening”)
- analytical (“how can we understand what is happening”)
- prescriptive (“how can we improve the situation”)

``closely intertwined because a researcher's descriptive, analytical, and normative perspectives on science-politics relations determine what (s)he observes, how (s)he analyses the observations and what prescriptions (s)he proposes''

Problem structuring theory - two dimensions:
- puzzling - expert side - certainty of knowledge
- powering - political/policy side - agreement on goals

 result in 4 types of problem:
 - structured problems - low puzzling low powering; akin to RittelW1073 tame problems
 - moderately structured problems, goals agreed - high puzzling low powering
 - moderately structured problems, means agreed - low puzzling high powering
 - unstructured problems - high puzzling high powering; akin to RittelW1973 wicked problems
 
 Boundary work has constrasting features:
 coordination between puzzling and powering to co-produce solutions - profane 
 demarcation between puzzling and powering to maintain objectivity - sacred
 
 [MidgleyMB1998 use the distinction between sacred and profane slightly differently but I wonder if they can be considered the same?]
 
Balancing act between credibility and usefulness
 
4 activities needed for policy problem processing (occur at multiple levels in society):
- problem framing
- problem structuring
- knowledge and actor selection
- regulating relations between science and society

levels in society, influence is between adjacent levels, each is described in detail:
1. macro-level - political-cultural sphere - determined by political culture and regulatory style - Renn created typology of these spheres
2. meso-level - policy problem networks - information, communication, resource and power result in networks specilising in particular policy issue - typology is based on problem structuring and uses policy coalition/community theories (see policy issue politics below)
3. boundary organizations - between professional-academic networks and public/policy organisation - 3 features: double participation, dual accountability, use of boundary objects
4. micro-level - policy advice and implementation projects - e.g. statements for policymakers from IPCC, CRELE model fits here

policy issue politics are structured using the puzzling/powering model, tensions arise if problem is dealt with in the wrong way (wrong-problem problem):
- structured problems - regulatory policy in closed professional/technical community
- moderately structured problems, goals agreed - advocacy coalition politics and/or problem-driven search, in oligopolistic policy subsystems
- moderately structured problems, means agreed - discourse coalition politics, accommodation strategies, or conflict management in designed issue network(s)
- unstructured problems - agenda-changing politics, crisis management; deliberation and learning in emergent network(s)

Failure to solve environmental crises is failure to to recognise that these are less structured problems (Funtowicz/Ravetz)

``There is overwhelming evidence that responses to (new) policy developments are influenced by political cultures and regulatory styles in the political-cultural sphere ... For example, Jordan, Benson, Wurzel, and Zito (2011) clearly show how policy instrument design in European climate change governance is strongly influenced by national policy styles and cultures''

Links wicked problems and public value. Goes on to question how public governance can be changed to include all affected interests - including local, national and global sphere?

Uses example of forced migration to describe how different discourse coalitions can exist, particularly with wicked problems e.g.:
- human rights, safety and welfare of individual refugees
- protecting national economic, welfare, sociocultural and security interests

Framework has two dimensions (philosophical traditions and levels of experience), each with two aspects.

Moore's ``Recognizing Public Value'' (2013) recognises two philosophical traditions that relate to values [MestreAWRS202X have these plus two further schools of ethics]:
- consequentialism - utilitarian, judged by welfare of individuals
- deontological - principle, judged by consistency with ideas about justice, fairness, etc 

These philosophical traditions can be evaluated at 
- individual, or 
- collective, 

level of experience resulting in 4 quadrants for evaluating public value creation 

A discourse is likely to call attention to only a subset of these values - paper suggests that there are issues for which current policies lie inside the production possibility frontier meaning that improvements can be made on all the dimensions

Go on to consider complexities of the institutional/political dimension:
- organisations, institutions, sectors etc. have their own practices and logics
- there is no central authority or governance system
- those with responsibility to solve are often those who caused the problem
- media attention can increase rivalry among coalitions making consensus harder to come by

Arbiters of social and public value - who determines value:
- individuals
- individuals voluntarily aligned to other individuals
- citizens subject to law and governance in a political jurisdiction

Objects of social and publuc value - what is valued:
- the material well-being of the valuer
- the material well-being of the others in the society
- the desires of individuals and groups to live up their social duties
- the valuer's ideals of a good and just society

Discusses finding solutions by experimentation and democracy (deliberation) at local (and national) and global (and transnational) scales as well as interconnections to connect all these together - noting the lack of authorising environment at the global scale but also the global and local civil society can influence national states and international organisations},

Suggest considerations and practices that may give decision makers a strategic advantage toward a successful integration of science into decisions:
- be clear about decision context (the demand, not the supply) cites McNie2007 [reflects also GluckmanBK2021, which doesn't cite McNie]
- lead resolutely but listen attentively - avoid the intervention of those who would like exercise control over the framing (such as industrial players, scientists)
- understand the ``best available science'' mandate - there are many facets to what is best, what is available, how other knowledge is integrated
- secure and trust a reliable science provider - e.g. knowledge broker, boundary spanner, etc.
- take a peek in the future - [few citations here, perhaps because its a bit woo]

From the interviews they develop a typology of 3 discourse coalitions:
- analytical - concerned with the explanatory power of different conceptualisations of evidence and policy relations, evidence-based/informed, often organised along disciplinary lines
- advocacy -  more normative and concerned with refining and prescribing idealised kinds of evidence and policy relations that should take place, tend to be somewhat territorial
- application - approaches evidence and policy relations as contingent on context and is concerned with the techniques, conditions and evaluative choices through which these relations are put into practice

For each they describe:
- problem perception
- practices to address that problem
- people involved
- priorities for future development of the domain

Individuals may move between coalitions as part of their roles and arising from different organisations and institutions, and identify that there are benefits to exchange, collaboration and co-mingling between the discourses

Detail how they identified individuals to interview:
- reviewed the Snapshot of the Evidence Informed Landscape from European Commission in 2017
-  considered potential contributors to be those who had actively engaged and reflected on meta-level questions about the scope, organisation and operation of the field of evidence and policy, through publications, commentaries, talks and workshops
- drew upon prior knowledge of potential contributors who were familiar to the authors from interactions at conferences, workshops and through relevant academic and practitioner networks, notably INGSA

Includes example questions

Some potentially useful citations e.g. reviews of evidence and policy literature (mainly health) - e.g. Oliver, Cairney, Pankhurst

``choice of discourse coalitions in this paper rather than other similar approaches ... stemmed from an initial interest in the discursive framing of evidence and policy relations through distinct terminologies, such as evidence-based policy or evidence-informed decision making ... builds upon constructivist traditions (Phillips and Hardy, 2002) by suggesting that language is the primary means through which different actors articulate their perception of a given problem and position themselves in relation to it, as well as to each other''

Some cracking quotes from named interviewees - well worth returning to!

Paul Cairney: ``if you had studied politics, you would know that science is often privileged [in policy making], but it's just not as central to the discussion as someone who is ensconced in science might think''},

Emissions calculators reduce individual to role of consumer, but there are other roles in 6 domains:
- energy in the home
- transport
- shopping
- influence - volunteering, career, talking, etc
- citizenship - voting, investing, activism
- food

Human behaviour models tend to distinguish between two influences, with more psychology focus on the first, although evidence is that this distinction is often blurred:
- intrinsic (values, personality traits, and abilities) and 
- extrinsic (norms, meanings, and material and political structures)

This work identifies 4 main sources of influence (each with references):
- individual
  - psychological - values, traits, skills
  - demographic - education, social advantage (group)
- social
  - cultural - norms, social pressure, role models, aspiration
  - social capital - community organisations, social networks
- physical
  - material - income and wealth, assets, availability of products
  - spatial - access to infrastructure (transport, utilities)
- political
  - governance and democracy - devolution, citizens assemblies, rights to protest, freedom of press, ...

The first message was either a neutral (control) newspaper article or a threat-based article describing findings of a new report. The second message was a ``solution'' policy initiative article with iether a gain or loss frame.

Great overviews of science of emotions:
- emotional response to threat - threat messages evoke fear, conflict about whether a fear response to a climate change message persuades individuals to act
- emotional response to efficacy appeals - efficacy messages mostly evoke hope but there is difference between liberals and moderates, and conservatives
- emotional flow - progression of multiple emotions such as fear to hope

Also gives overviews of different framings of climate change:
- gain/loss framing [more nuanced results are given in low- and high- power loss/gain in Kahneman2011]
- gain/loss framing in climate change ``gain and loss framing effects are likely better explained by accounting for mediating and moderating contextual and affective forces ... emotion''
- framing and emotions - emotions as frames

Found:
- Gain-framed climate change efficacy information elicit more hope than loss-framed efficacy information
- Loss-framed climate change efficacy information elicit more fear than gain-framed efficacy information
- The effects of efficacy information framing on climate change attitudes and advocacy behaviors were mediated by message-generated emotional arousal (hope or fear)
- Exposure to the threat-based message led to greater hope after exposure to the solutions-oriented efficacy message, regardless of how it was framed

the intensity of fear experienced from reading the threatening message influenced the intensity of both fear and hope in response to reading the subsequent solution-oriented efficacy message

Greater persuasive effect was achieved through the sequencing of emotional experiences - I understand that the greatest persuasion was with the first message being fear-inducing and the second being hope-framed efficacy},

1. The current state of trust in climate science and climate scientists
2. Reasons for distrust
3. How political engagement affects trust
 
Trust in scientists not affected by their respectful advocacy for greater climate action but their credibility may be affected by advocating for a specific policy (section 4) (see also papers in DablanderSCSBGGBAH2024)

Perceptions of scientists' large carbon footprint have a negative affect on their credibility

Scientists considered more trustworthy if they were advocating for policy that respondent already supported

Greater trustworthiness perceptions may be gained by demonstrating competence, benevolence, integrity, and openness:
- integrity - walk the walk by reducing their personal carbon footprints, especially if they advocate for carbon footprint reductions
- benevolence - can be increased by public and political engagement, especially when advocating for policies with high public support
- benevolence - providing prosocial motivations in scientist biographies
- openness - being transparent about their funding and data sources, and by declining funding from sources that entail obvious conflicts of interest

These work differently for different audiences

Emotion of research may impact trustworthiness, with angry being less persuasive than sad, but not by much and the emotion of the audience matters (more research needed on emotions [I think Aaron Thierry is looking at this])

Political leaning of audience also matters, conservative republicans trust primary care doctors and television weather forecasters more than climate scientsts - suggest communicating with intermediaries not just directly with public},

  comment          = {Because ``reductions in emissions at the maximum rate deemed reasonable it is challenging, or impossible'' greenhouse gas reduction (GGR) is required

Very clearly written apparently thorough report of the possiblities for GGR. 

Some of the citations used are rather old and I wonder if they are still relevant

Test out the options with ascenarios: ``considered a plausible, albeit highly challenging, route to net-zero emissions'' ``with many methods deployed at the limit of their maximum deployment''

GGR methods:
- Forestation
- Habitat restoration
- Soil carbon sequestration - changing land management
- Biochar
- Bioenergy with carbon capture and storage (BECCS) 
- Ocean fertilisation
- Building with biomass
- Enhanced terrestrial weathering
- Mineral carbonation - injecting GHG into rocks in or ex situ
- Ocean alkalinity
- Direct air capture and carbon storage (DACCS) 
- Low-carbon concrete
- other approaches are also briefly described
- approaches to removing GHGs other than CO2 are also described

Detail is given on each is provided in chapter 2, including technology readiness, scalability and engineering challenges, and social and policy factors (discussion and examples of social and policy contexts of each method)

Chapter 3 discusses cross-cutting issues: resources, storage, environment, science and technology, economics, legislation, social aspects

Figure 3 shows all these approaches - DACCS stands out as a minor player [but I would argue is what most people think of as GGR]

First recommendation is to continue and increase efforts to reduce GHG emissions

Recommendations include importing sustainable biomass

Need to (p 82) ``ensure more level incentives at the margin for GGR and to pump-prime the CCS market, overcoming `first of a kind' costs and investment hold-up problems'', options:
- carbon pricing
- regulation standards
- obligation on fossil fuel companies

There's a diagram (Figure 3) in the summary, not the main report, that appears to indicate more than 50\% of something will be done with BECCS and DACCS - this is under the Net-zero in 2050 scenario. The curious thing here is that these two technologies are ``requiring CCS'' but neither ``ready for deployment'' nor ``not yet demonstrated at scale''.

`` CCS is largely at the demonstration stage''
``Bioenergy is already supported in many national policy frameworks''
``The ecological impacts of ocean fertilisation on the marine food web and fisheries, and the downstream effects on nutrient supply, productivity and food web dynamics are extremely difficult to predict [e.g.] Some iron fertilisation experiments have demonstrated that toxin-producing algae may be stimulated, leading to `harmful algal blooms' that can be toxic to wildlife and humans''
``A rigorous cost-benefit analysis including co-benefits has not yet been performed''
``It is estimated that [DACCS] currently lie between pilot plant development and prototype demonstration in the field''
``The technology and storage requirements of DACCS are similar to those of power generation and CCS and so the timescale of ramp-up will also be comparable''
``Large scale deployment by 2050, with early deployment in 2030, should be possible from a technical point of view'' [unreferenced?]
``Many GGR technologies could be economically profitable with carbon prices in the 2030 recommended range of $50 to $100 per tCO2''
``Efforts to deploy GGR technologies can be economically and environmentally counterproductive if spatial [e.g. impacts of growing crops for GGR] and temporal [e.g. efforts delay but don't solve problem] `leakage' effects are not considered''
``Given the short timeframe on which deployment is required, governments may choose to directly intervene in markets. This might alleviate the high costs associated with `first of a kind' activities, while building experience in the sector and enabling any associated economic spillovers''
`` There are too many variables and uncertainties for these to provide absolute solutions, However they present plausible, though not necessarily optimal or desirable, future worlds in which ambitious efforts are made to limit climate change using GGR''},

  abstract         = {Abstract Carbon dioxide removal is rapidly becoming a key focus in climate research and politics. This is raising concerns of “moral hazard” or “mitigation deterrence,” that is, the risk that promises of and/or efforts to pursue carbon removal end up reducing or delaying near-term mitigation efforts. Some, however, contest this risk, arguing that it is overstated or lacking evidence. In this review, we explore the reasons behind the disagreement in the literature. We unpack the different ways in which moral hazard/mitigation deterrence (MH/MD) is conceptualized and examine how these conceptualizations inform assessments of MH/MD risks. We find that MH/MD is a commonly recognized feature of modeled mitigation pathways but that conclusions as to the real-world existence of MH/MD diverge on individualistic versus structural approaches to examining it. Individualistic approaches favor narrow conceptualizations of MH/MD, which tend to exclude the wider political-economic contexts in which carbon removal emerges. This exclusion limits the value and relevance of such approaches. We argue for a broader understanding of what counts as evidence of delaying practices and propose a research agenda that complements theoretical accounts of MH/MD with empirical studies of the political-economic structures that may drive mitigation deterrence dynamics. This article is categorized under: The Carbon Economy and Climate Mitigation > Benefits of Mitigation The Social Status of Climate Change Knowledge > Sociology/Anthropology of Climate Knowledge Policy and Governance > Multilevel and Transnational Climate Change Governance},
  comment          = {Review of literature considering whether there is a moral hazard / mitigation delay (MH/MD) caused by developing GGR technologies. Great for literature on GGR and policy and understanding the balance of the arguments around this. Section 4 is especially good for this.

3 types of literature:

- the role of CDR in IAMs, where there is general agreement that MH/MD exists, yet disagreement as to whether this results in real-world MH/MD - tends to agree that inclusion of CDR substitutes for reduction
- attempts to assess MH/MD risks outside of models:
  - MH/MD as an expression of individualist preferences, choices, and actions - tends to find little evidence for MH/MD
  - MH/MD as the outcome of structural dynamics in society - indicates that there may be MH/MD and there is a need for a structural understanding of MH/MD

``a now extensive literature argues that specific assumptions made across IAMs result in modeled mitigation pathways that downplay the need and opportunities for phasing out fossil fuels, which in turn may inspire political complacency''

Literature considering structural dynamics ``suggests that a combination of economic and political commitments to existing infrastructures and energy strategies is creating path dependencies that make non-CDR pathways seem unfeasible'' - incumbent actors (dominant interests) are releived of their reponsibility to reduce emissions now

``a substantial literature discusses structural mitigation deterrence dynamics, drawing on a wide range of backgrounds and concepts, and often describing MH/MD as an outcome of neoliberal capitalism''

Concise history of CDR in the literature is interesting},

  comment          = {A stonkingly clear and powerful overview of the reasons why GHG emissions have risen despite wide recognision of the problem of global heating

``Historical accounts suggest that there was a shared understanding among influential industrialists, scientists, and politicians as early as the late 1980s that anthropogenic climate change was a real concern and that action was needed''

``The literature reviewed for this article, collectively suggests that a key impediment to successful climate mitigation over the past three decades is the pervasive failure to [question many of the core tenets of modern, industrialized societies]''

Review this through 9 lenses, each undertaken by relevant experts:
1. international climate governance
2. the vested interests of the fossil fuel industry
3. geopolitics and militarism (manifest in global extractivism)
4. economics and financialization
5. mitigation modeling
6. energy supply systems
7. inequity
8. high-carbon lifestyles - attempts to influence behaviour aren't working, many high-carbon activities are habitual
9. social imaginaries

``power emerged as a particularly important thread to emphasize''

Power described in different forms:
- Davos cluster - embedded unchallanged power - lenses 1, 2, and 3
- Enabler cluster - instrumental power, responses to all issues can be addressed within the contemporary socioeconomic paradigm, but with the power to undermine the status quo - lenses 4, 5 and 6
- Ostrich and Phoenix cluster - the power of ideas, experimentation and cultural change if willing to take head out of the sand - lenses 7, 8, and 9

``economic schools, whether orthodox or heterodox, have generally failed to incorporate biophysical reality''

Some nice discussions of integrated assessment models IAMs - sections 4.1 (lens 4) and 4.2 (lens 5)

``a new environmental asset class is now being created that includes so-called green securitizations of carbon offsets and natural disaster insurance---catastrophe, or cat, bonds ... As with carbon markets, cat bonds have thus far failed to live up to their promises of providing protection and raise major ethical concerns, such as exacerbating the severe and already unequal distribution of climate impacts''

``Since the fourth IPCC assessment report, IAMs have become heavily reliant on large-scale carbon dioxide removal (CDR), or negative emissions. To date, IAMs have included two forms of CDR: afforestation (AF) and bioenergy with carbon capture and storage (BECCS), with work ongoing to include other approaches (such as direct air capture and storage)''

Mechanism related to inequity:
1. decouples the vulnerable from the powerful
2. erodes social trust required for collective action
3. reinforces the preference of elites for a status quo hostile to climate action

There are scarce plausible social imaginaries because:
1. construction of new imaginaries builds on existing representationsm which are ``deeply entangled with fossil fuels''
2. ``with technocratic forms of modeling, cost-benefit analysis, and forecasting at the core of most governmental and industrial imaginaries, the future continues to be framed as open to exploitation''
3. ``certain visions of the future are actively marginalized and different groups' capacity to imagine better futures systematically eroded''},

To explore these, one must be held constant while the change in the other two is analysed. Thresholds in probability and time are aribrary. However, there are non-arbitrary thresholds of impact that can be plotted as probability over time. Examples include:
- physical - sea-level that puts an island under water
- biophysical - degree of heat and humidity that exceeds the tolerance of humans or crops
- biochemical - the degree of acidity that prevents shellfish forming shells
- experiential - the impact of a well-understood past event such as a particular storm

- Development pathway - more equitable distribution of mitigation effort, where nations with low per-capita emissions expand fossil energy systems for an extended period

Group most highly emitting nations into 10 groups of similar emissions characteristics over time

They exceed the 4\% per annum reduction rate that was typical at the time

BECCS typically up to 1 third of current global electricity - but there aren't robust operating costs despite BECCS often being considered low-cost option

IAMs don't have much capacity to include socio-technical and socio-economic change due to conventional economic frameworks

widespread deployment of pathways with NET is technically too speculative, uncertain in terms of efficacy and feedbacks, and with critical issues on the scale and scope of available biomass inadequately understood

``Considerations of fairness should therefore start to include aspects beyond domestic emissions reductions only''

- beneficiary pays (e.g. historic fossil fuel sales)

return to if discussing advocacy

covers:
- the established role of scientists in society and four conceptualized roles of a scientist in public policy making
- the role of scientists in biodiversity conservation, building on long-running debate in the field of conservation biology
- the impact of the institutional setting on science and scientists, comparing academia with environmental non-governmental organizations (eNGOs), using the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds (RSPB) as a case study
- the challenges and risks at the coalface of science and policy
- ask whether it is enough for scientists to be detached `honest brokers' in policy formation and suggest a way forward.

Uses Pielke2007's roles at the policy interface (see RapleyD2014 and GluckmanBK2021):
- pure scientist
- science arbiter
- issue advocate
- honest broker of policy alternatives
- add honest advocate

place these roles on 2 axes:
- potential to have policy influence
- potential risk to scientific credibility

``Pielke also observes that `Pure Scientist' and `Science Arbiters' can, inadvertently or intentionally, slip into 'stealth mode' and act as advocates should they begin to present information that is partial or biased''

``Many scientists in academia would resemble a Science Arbiter in Pielke's model' ... will also act regularly as Honest Brokers ... a small but growing number of high-profile academics also act vocally as Issue Advocates on both climate and nature''. Later say that taking on issue advocate role can undermine confidence in science but question if it is enough for scientists to be solely honest brokers given the urgency and complexity of the challenge. 

``RSPB scientists resemble Honest Brokers''

``the risk to scientific credibility might be equally high if scientists failed to engage actively in advocacy too, especially when they judge threats to be extreme''

Discusses Richard Pearson's book `Driven to Extinction' and how it is concerned about ``crying wolf'' [false positive]

Notes that conservation science differs from medical science, in which the ``mission to do good sits easily'' and there is little moral panic if scietists share policy goals

``the Scientific Method Is Characterized By Accuracy, Precision, Repeatability And Impartiality, And Uses Communal Mechanisms Such As Critiques, Peer Review, Open Discussion, Conferences And Independent Assessment To Scrutinize, Validate And Update Scientific Claims''

Worse, because the climate movement and profession are acting from within the system they fail to advocate for humanity's major concerns and can advocate instead for ecoauthoritarian policies

``Dr Knorr explains that climate science is not a 'hard science' but involves subjective choice that perpetuates the prejudices of elites. That is partly why the profession focuses on the noise not the signal, the secondary not the salient''

``former IPCC chair Bob Watson admitting that the iron rule that bad news must be packaged in cheery optimism has now once and for all been thoroughly refuted''

``because they are so siloed, middle class, and technocratic, both the climate movement and profession are not aligned with humanity's other major concerns and social trends. Therefore, they risk becoming an agent of authoritarianism''

Useful outline of agency. Social Cognitive Theory (Bandura, 2001) suggests that people need to feel they can influence to be incentivised to act. There are 3 types of agency:
- personal - preferred - but if too much responsibility, may turn to:
- proxy - individual enlists external resources to reduce burden
- collective - team with shared goal

Aim to identify how environmental researchers engage with policy theory

Useful for references to work that considers:
- just climate policy
- how climate researchers establish feasible pathways to policy change
- how climate researchers use key theories as part of a framework to assess climate governance
- what researchers are looking for and what they find regarding policy

Find that, unlike review of health research, there is little use of policy theory to seek practical lessons such as how to advocate for policy change

Call for climate-related policy research to be more informed by policy theory. Insights of value to climate justice research:
1. major policy change is rare and difficult to predict
2. policy making is subject to bounded rationality
3. policymakers operate in complex environment

``While theory-informed studies do not solve the problems raised by climate justice scholars, they provide the concepts or language to help identify patterns and mechanics of policy change, which should help to raise research questions pertinent to the ongoing study of climate change action''

More detailed results on 
- the amount of attention to climate justice in governance
- different definitions of climate justice (and who wins and loses)
- the policy changes that researchers seek
  - transformation of systems of governance
  - mainstreaming of justice / policy integration
  - organise to overcome neoliberalism
  - design effective policy tools
- the policy changes that researchers find:
  - includes a list of examples of knowledge policy gaps
- how researchers use policy theory

Identifies strategies of PEs, some normative principles and from this derive democratic deficiencies of PEs.

Particularly covers liberal democracies and deliberative democracies and considers many are liberal with deliberative aspects.

Great literature review covering theories of policy entrepreneurs, their motives and strategies. Also the theories of legitimacy, accountability and justice in liberal and deliberative democracies.

Detail describing, particularly, recent polical upheavals in Sweden around popularism and climate denialism of political (public sector) actors (including evidence of troll factories, orchestration by neoliberal Atlas network).

``policy entrepreneurs do not only impact agenda-setting, policy preferences, and policies and their outcomes, but also procedures and normative principles of liberal and deliberative democratic governance---positively or negatively, intentionally or unintentionally.''

PE approaches to policy change - using strategies:
- Attention and support seeking strategies - Problem framing; idea generation. Strategic dissemination of information. Lead by example; use demonstration projects. Rhetorical persuasion; media attention. Exploitation of focusing event(s).
- Linking strategies - Coalition and team building with bureaucratic insiders and policy influencers outside of government. Issue linking. Game linking.
- Relational management strategies - Networking by using social acuity. Trust building. 
- Arena strategies - Venue shopping. Timing.

Critical of Mintrom's uncritical discussion of the need for more policy entrepreneurs

The model of policy entrepreneurship, that PEs are a fact and are (should be) part of the political process fails to address questions of legitimacy, accountability, justice

Identifies six interrelated democratic norms and principles, on which should be based critical research on the role of policy entrepreneurs in, and their impact on, liberal and deliberative democracies:
1. legitimacy - input, throughput and output legitimacy 
2. accountability
3. transparency and publicity
4. openness and equality
5. impartiality and fairness
6. justice - procedural and distributive

Relates 3-6 to 1 and 2 in table 2

Use this framework to analyse two cases and revises the model of strategic behaviour and impacts to include political ideology in the context and influencing motvies.

Go on to suggest that interest groups such as Fridays for Future (FFF) and Extinction Rebellion (XR) are not invited to the table because they don't offer solutions - and that they should therefore propose solutions. yet acknowledges that such groups cannot easily meet at the hegemonic environmental democracy as they see it as part of the problem.


``there is a lack of systematic research on whether the presence of policy entrepreneurs has a positive or negative impact on democracy and different democratic values and norms'' - a proposes a series of questions for consideration

Lobbyism is related to policy entrepreneurism and much better known 

Classes climate change among the ``more pervasive public policy issues [for which] public executives and legislators [are] more open for advocacy of stakeholders from different sectors and social spheres''

``Success is not only determined by the characteristics, actions, and strategies of policy entrepreneurs, but also the context which shapes their actions''

``illiberal and antidemocratic actors using democratic institutions and functions to reach their Ultimate Goal''

policy entrepreneur concept was introduced by Robert A. Dahl in the 1960s and popularized by John W. Kingdon in the 1980s},

Using data from 125 interviews, we ask: How are foundational experts contesting the conduct of anticipatory assessment of carbon removal and solar geoengineering – as two emerging but controversial strategies for engaging with climate change and achieving Net Zero targets? We find that efforts at carbon removal and solar geoengineering assessment leverage and challenge systems modeling that has become dominant in mapping and communicating future climate impacts and mitigation strategies via IPCC reports. Both suites of climate intervention have become stress-tests for the capacity of modeling to assess socio-technical strategies with complex, systemic dimensions. Meanwhile, exploring societal dimensions demands new modes of disciplinary expertise, qualitative and deliberative practices, and stakeholder inclusion that modelling processes struggle to incorporate. Finally, we discuss how the patterns of expert contestation identified in our results speak to multiple fault-lines within ongoing debates on reforming global environmental assessments, and highlights key open questions to be addressed.},

- the formal and informal institutions that guide their actions at each level; 
- the networks they form; 
- the ideas or beliefs that dominate the ways in which they think about problems and solutions; 
- the biophysical and socio-economic conditions to which they respond; 
- and the events that offer opportunities and shocks''

what works in one setting may not work in another ``The solution is not to give up on lesson learning and generalizability, but to emphasize the shifting context and often ephemeral nature of our recommendations''

Steps to making the most of new policy sciences:
1. Learn from psychology and cognitive sciences to improve our model of choice
2. Consider how policy advice is used in complex contexts.

  comment          = {Consider 4 models of research-policy relations:
1. research -> policy - supply model - knowledge shapes policy
2. research <- policy/politics - political power shapes knowledge
3. research <o> policy - research knowledge and governance are co-produced  through ongoing mutual constitution - co-production [note - technologies of hubris]
4. research -> | <- policy - there is no overarching causality - politics selectively appropriates and gives meaning to scientific findings - autonomous spheres

Discusses each with reference to literature

1. knowledge shapes policy - common conceptualisation, behind evidence-based policymaking, gap between research and policy communties due to e.g. poor communication of research. Suggest that a better approach would be for multiple authors to develop policy messages from diverse studies - this is very different to current impact pathways - ``widely debunked''
2. politics shapes knowledge - power relations are implicated in construction of expert authority, powerful interests shape research process, commissioned research cannot be independent, policy institutions and procedures shape engagement [e.g. CalverleyA2022 Carton2021], naïve to assume that researchers can speak truth to power
3. co-production - Jasanoff knowledge making is inherent in state-making, performativity, new techniques bring about new epistemologies, technologies of hubris, thus cannot neatly identify impact, research may create problems while solving problems
4. autonomous spheres - ``science and politics are separate function-systems'', how do the systems pick up and give meaning to signals from each other?, how does the politics system model the science system? garbage-can model? is research taken up by politics to signal legitimacy rather than for informing policy?

Nature of measures such as REF is that they are based on simply linear concept of research-policy relations, that impact can and should be measured:
- can lead to gaming and `impact mercantalism'
- if 4 is the case: ``the impact agenda has been designed to suit the needs of a political, rather than scientific, system and should be treated cautiously by researchers given its potential to divert science from its core task of developing truth claims''
- if 2 or 4, incentivising impact is flawed, decoupled from research quality
- research impact ``involves subtle, incremental and diffuse ideational adjustments over a long period of time, which are generated by a wide range of research insights rather than specific individual findings'', should reward collaborative endeavours},

Some proposed solutions, like teaching scientists to communicate more effectively, can be helpful, but are not necessarily sufficient. Instead, connecting science and policy may often require a separate kind of expert: full-time intermediaries who facilitate the complicated exchange of information among scientists, policy-makers, and other stakeholders. In this paper, we describe intermediary efforts by the Lenfest Ocean Program, a grant-making program that funds peer-reviewed research and connects scientists and decision-makers who can take action on an issue. We present case studies of intermediary work on three topics: first, sustainable methods of harvesting bull kelp in the US Pacific Northwest; second, the design of catch share programs in US fisheries; and third, management of forage fish. These case studies suggest that science-policy intermediaries can help scientists make meaningful contributions to public discourse.}},

``connecting science and policy is not a part-time, `do it yourself' enterprise, but instead benefits from the skills and experience of practitioners who are immersed in the process''

Noting how much effort doing science brokerage is, ``We suggest that a separate kind of expert---one who has the time and expertise to engage with both science and policy---can play a vital role at this interface that scientists themselves rarely can. This is the aspiration of science-policy intermediaries, or boundary organizations. These are enterprises and individuals that specialize in facilitating the complicated and erratic flow of information among scientists, policy-makers, and various stakeholders, while generally refraining from advocating for specific policy positions.'' brokers for scientific information (ref Pielke2007 and Meyer 2010 [The rise of the knowledge broker].

- Strategic grant-making capability
- Analytical skills to critically appraise evidence and synthesize multiple lines of research
- Writing skills
- Creative design skills
- Policy expertise related to pertinent laws, regulations, and administrative agencies to identify information needs
- Knowledge of social science theory related to decision-making and impact assessment
- Communication expertise
- Integrative capacity, or specialized generalists who can identify opportunities to connect science and policy and coordinate an overall science-policy outreach strategy

section 4.1 nice summary of the kinds of strategies for scientists that are found literature
section 4.2 measuring impact is difficult in any complex setting

An early project demonstrated how difficult it is to trace knowledge input to policy outcomes. A later project led them to consider metrics of success

Through learning, developed many different means to convey information into policy ``intermediary efforts'' that include summaries of reports, fact sheets, videos, media outreach, briefings, and presentations to many different stakeholders

``our intermediary efforts were successful in informing a variety of discussions and influencing some policy changes''

Further, these materials were used by some Indigenous communities to advocate for more sustainable fisheries

But this wasn't enough - thus undertook a retrospective assessment interviews, surveys, etc to understand how and why decision makers and advocate used their findings and what could be improved for different users

``strategies [ensure that their results are clear, relevant, timely, credible, and sensitive to stakeholder needs and perspectives, being better communicators and more policy literate, and presenting `actionable' and `usable' research to stakeholders] alone are not necessarily sufficient to ensure that science and policy integration occurs, and they present quite a workload. As we have suggested through the examples in this paper, the efforts required in the enterprise of connecting science and policy can often exceed the skill sets or time constraints of individual scientists''},

Literature Review Of Relationship Between Knowledge And Climate Governance, Finds 4 Clusters
- Usable Scientific Knowledge - Cash Et Al 2003 [crele Framework], communication/translation/mediation, involving stakeholders/honest broker
- Politics of Science - particularly from international relations, Hoppe et al 2017, epistemic communities, legitimacy and legitimation
- Critical Visions - STS and integration of insights from different fields, Jasanoff and the need to integrate different epistemologies, power, pervasiveness of Western epistemologies, situated knowledge and mutual learning
- Hybrid Approaches

Held 3 workshops within their organisation to discuss the findings of the literature.

Scientists found ``usable knowledge'' too simplistic, identifying instead with ``politics of science'' perspective in a setting of complex governance. ``Our scientists recognized that interventions took place in a knowledge system inserted in a society with profound and stable patterns of social, political and cultural practice, forming the rules of a civic epistemology''

Found that excellent, relevance, credibility, legitimacy are necessary but not suffiient precursers for taking a seat at the table in climate governance. That need the organisation to be proactively involved with shared values and ``the country's civic epistemology, with believes in a duty of science to serve the country''},

For science to effectively inform policy, scientists must have training that enhances their understanding of the movement of knowledge across boundaries, e.g., between science and policy. This training should be based on existing perceptions scientists at all career stages have about potential roles they might play. In this study, geoscientists’ drawings of their perceptions of the diffusion of science into policy were collected and salient features were coded. For comparison, four expert models were also collected from individuals with extensive experience working at the interface between science and policy. A principal component analysis identified common patterns in the relationships depicted in the geoscientists’ drawings, resulting in five distinctive models describing different perceived roles scientists might play in the diffusion of science into policy: a beacon informing decisions, a collaborator working alongside policymakers to co-produce knowledge, an educator enhancing the capacity of society in the classroom and media, an outcast whose efforts to inform are rejected, and an investigator whose research may or may not be used depending on how others interpret it. Increasing the effectiveness of scientists’ engagements requires enhancing their ability to understand potential roles that they might play; understanding what roles are most appropriate for them; and discerning how they can best fulfill these roles in their work. Suggestions for cultivating this capacity are offered based on the expert models and a discussion of guided reflection within experiential learning in the classroom and beyond.}},

Present a typology classifying any research activity. This comprises 3 activities, each with 4-6 attributes and each attribute has a value range between science (as a closed system) values and user (research is open to engagement) values. Each of these attributes can be understood by a specific question (abbreviated here):
1. knowledge production:
  - expertise - epistemic <-> experiential - who has credibility to product knowledge?
  - relevance - general <-> contextual - how is research relevant to solving specific problem?
  - disciplinary focus - singular, narrow <-> transdisciplinary, diverse - how discipline-driven are the knowledge production activities?
  - uncertainty - reduce uncertainty <-> manage uncertainty - how is uncertainty understood and addressed?
  - goals for research - exploratory <-> outcome oriented - what are the epistemic goals?
2. learning and engagement:
  - learning - theoretical <-> social, practical - how to outputs change knowledge sytem?
  - knowledge exchange - narrow <-> iterative, influential - how much and how is knowledge exchanged?
  - network participation - homogeneous <-> heterogeneous - who participates in the knowledge network?
  - social capital - negligible <-> significant - how important is development and deployment of social capital?
3. organisation and institutional processes: 
  - accessibility - constrained <-> high - how accessible to users are researchers/their organisations/institutions?
  - outputs - narrow <-> diverse - how various are the outputs and outcomes?
  - evaluation and effectiveness - science-centric <-> public-value oriented - what factors shape evaluation?
  - flexibility - constrained <-> responsive - how easy to respond to users' needs?
  - human capital - narrow <-> broad - what skills and training are needed?
  - boundary management - limited <-> broad - how effort is needed to manage the boundary?

[note the repetition of ``narrow'' and ``constrained'' under science values]

``whose interests are represented in the shaping of research agendas? Power and representation may be concentrated in a few hands, namely, in the funding agencies, principal investigators, researchers, and may also extend to the research institutes, centers and universities in which research takes place ...

Really useful reference for understanding the range of work on science-policy interface - see topics below

But under experiences the impression is very much that it is not about the experience of scientists

Part I: The goal 
- useful information must be salient, credible, legitimate [also Cash et al 2003]

Part II: The lessons of experience
- historical trends - national and international agencies, stakeholder involvement, new institutions, ...
- conditioning factors:
  - policy - endless frontier, linear model, other models
  - civil society - now more engaged
  - science -barriers between science and society, and science and policy: uncertainty, scale differences, culture
  - knowledge and decision systems - need for more social and behavioural understanding

Part III: Alternatives and processes for improving
- alternatives:
  - scientists need to align more to policy needs
  - stakeholders should be included in the decision-making process
  - building social capital - trust, respect, cooperation - between scientists and decision makers
  - scientists and decision makers need to actively manage the boundary
  - strengthen linkages between science and policy
  - improve communication
  - develop new ways of thinking about the process
- process:
  - various participatory approaches
  - adaptive management
  - science shops and community-based research
  - boundary organisations

1. reporting
2. interpreting
3. integrating
4. taking a position
5. decision making

``those that are personally most involved in the scientific process and producing research results (scientists), and those responsible for integrating those results in the management of public lands (managers), are the most critical about the scientific process and least receptive to positivist beliefs''

Also a reasonable support for advocacy even technocracy

Neat history of scientific philosophy from positivist roots, enlightement, Kuhn, Polanyi

Levien 1979 identified 3 roles for scientists:
1. provide a clear understanding of the basic dimensions of environmental problems, identifying both what is known and what is uncertain
2. describe and identify options for the appropriate solution of those problems, some of which might not be considered by political decision makers
3. contribute to the resolution of environmental problems by estimating the economic, social, environmental and political consequences of proposed solutions through time and space, and across population groups

Roles discussed in literature review:
1. traditional - provide relevant expertise about scientific data, theories, and findings that others in the policy-making process can use to make decisions (outgrowth of the Enlightenment and the philosophy of positivism)
2. integrative - scientists should become more integrated into management and policy processes (post-normal science)},

- Interpreting - interpreting science for policy makers and the public without taking a policy position (eg publishing an article in the popular media, being interviewed by a journalist, giving a public seminar).
- Integrating - integrating science into decision making through collaborations with policy makers without taking a policy position (eg providing expert advice, writing science briefs or white papers).
- Taking a position - actively supporting a position on a particular issue based on scientific results (eg participating in an organized campaign, writing op-eds, contacting politicians to voice opinions, speaking at rallies or protests).
- Decision making - acting as a decision maker with regard to policy.

most conclusions are a bit meh - males more likely to ..., PhDs more likely to ...

``scientists can highlight the importance of governmental funding for basic, translational, and applied research and how that funding relates to a `return on investment' on national priorities and global competitiveness ... can also help policymakers react in real time to emergent global issues''

Concerns with advocacy:
- biases of both parties
- need to develop of `elevator pitch'
- biases and limitations at scientific institutions, including but not limited to, a lack of incentive structures, institutional guidelines, and employment limitations

Suggests 5 approaches that will help:
1. remain issue-focussed
2. provide clear and accuracte information
3. be honest about uncertainty
4. be aware of own and audiences values, expertise, biases and needs
5. be aware of role of language

``seeks to understand how forest researchers navigate complex SPIs, and how they respond to the tensions that emerge when there are multiple actors and interests''

Conducted 23 semi-structured 55-80 minute interviews over 4 month period with experienced researchers in an international forest research organisation to analyse how they engaged in forest policy in the Global South at different governance levels perceive and respond to the tensions inherent in SPIs. As well as CRELE framework use inductive coding to identify 15 SPIs across 4 policy levels, 12 additional challenges (e.g. funding, government policies, project management) and 22 response strategies

``more nuanced understanding of the policy context, policy actors and their interlinked relationships is needed ... Deeper understanding of power relations is also crucial, including the sources and types of power, particularly in SPIs where multiple policy actors can claim the right of participation''

Clear write-up of the different areas of tensions and frustration experienced by researchers, e.g.
- being asked to prescribe policy by actors with more power
- disparities and swings in political priorities
- conflict outcomes of research and e.g. government's data or position leading to questioning of the science
- requests to change or remove content of papers or talks
- critical narratives leading to reputational harm for scientist
- country of origin in relation to country of policy having negative and positive effects on scientists' perceived legitimacy
- impact on research of funding and funders

Strategies - to actively manage tensions, e.g.:
- ensuring policy-relevance
- different framings of problems
- self-reflection, humbleness
- high-lighting rigorousness and transparency of research
- self-censorship - paragraph in discussion about this: ``The implications of researchers' self-censorship for the credibility of the SPIs remain unclear but they involve clearly a conflict of interest, which is a potential source of reputational risk for the SPIs and their participants (Tremblay et al., 2016)''
- building good relationships with policymakers was essential for policy relevance but also impacted ability to openly discuss critical research

Provide interview questions and coding scheme

Use Cash's CRELE credibility, relevance, legitimacy framework to understand the tensions in science-policy interfaces

Very relevant to my thesis - nice background such as brief overview of SPIs

``Given that forestry scientists are increasingly expected to contribute with societally relevant work, and within policy domains characterised by strong power asymmetries among the actors involved, there is a need for lessons that can be drawn from such experiences to inform future science-policy engagements for a more sustainable future''

``propose to understand expertise and evidence as socially embedded in authority relations and cultural contexts''

``policy-relevant facts are the result of an intensive and complex struggle for political and epistemic authority on both sides; science as well as policy ... what counts as evidence is defined by institutionally and discursively''

3 arguments:
1. policy-based evidence making might actually be the flip side of evidence-based policy (evidence-based policy rests on its own mechanisms of exclusion and selectivity)
2. deficits and side effects of evidence-based policy are more visible with more `regulatory science' (research agencies, advicory commissions, etc) - conflicts over the justifiability and accountability of expertise and evidence have emerged
3. the different national contexts are an issue of contestation with globally active science-policy organisations such as IPCC - and trying to find common ground creates concerns about the politicisation of science - `civic epistemologies'

``To understand these dynamics of evidence-based policy immunising itself against criticism and thus turning into policy-based evidence, more comparative research on the `embeddedness' of evidence and expertise is needed. In our paper we give an overview of recent studies that tackle these questions. Furthermore, our aim is to set out the configurations, contexts and mechanisms of policy-based evidence making''

Nice summary of UK evidence policy context

Review of literature on policy-based evidence making - evidence is neglected and distorted because it conflicts with political values and ideologies (normative selectivity) or it is ignored and misinterpreted as a result of limited politico-administrative perception (cognitive selectivity). This is influence by power asymmetries:
- knowledge monopolisation (cognitive selectivity + actor-related asymmetries)
- blame avoidance (normative selectivity + actor-related asymmetries)
- black-boxing (cognitive selectivity + instrument-related asymmetries)
- over-simplification (normative selectivity + instrument-related asymmetries)},

- identifying claims about the science-policy interface
- conducting an assessment of these claims by Science Of Actionable Knowledge (SOAK) researchers
- identifying a a future research agenda for SOAK

1. identify 26 claims about the science policy interface in the literature which cover:
  - assumptions
  - meaning
  - structure
  - engagement processes
  - outcomes
2. 13 claims were agreed with by expert group, 2 rejected and 11 were neither agreed or disagreed
3. 4 high-level questions for further research, each with subquestions:
  - How do we define and evaluate success in producing actionable knowledge?
  - How do we best situate and support intermediaries to accelerate actionable knowledge production?
  - What is the meaning and role of trust in science-society engagements?
  - Is consensus required for informing policies and what could alternative approaches look like?

Interesting conclusions:
- power, politics, and other governance issues relating to actionable knowledge, are only beginning to be examined
- researchers are hence starting to reframe co-production and other science-society engagements as governance processes that navigate politics and tensions
- need to understand how institutions and efforts can be designed to build mutual accountability, political legitimacy, and trust among participants and within broader societal contexts},

enquiry in interviews and surveys was structured using domains of enquiry within which themes could emerge

domains of enquiry, builds on BuseMW2012 [but seems to reduce the policy content aspect - which is relevant to my research]:
- Actors/Relationships -- roles, characteristics of and links between researchers, policymakers and other key players
- Research characteristics -- topic, quality, credibility, relevance, timeliness, presentation, etc
- Strategies -- professional influence-orientated behaviours of researchers
- Processes -- how events unfolded, barriers and enablers, case examples
- Context -- the overlapping 'worlds' of policy, politics, practice, research, advocacy, media and public opinion, including organisational and disciplinary cultures, and power structures
- Values -- ethics, traditions, ideology, controversy and vested interests

Weiss 1991 identify that research supports policy as:
- data - used instrumentally to inform policy decisions
- argument - used 
  - strategically to address values and interests, or 
  - symbolically to support, justify or refute predetermined positions
- ideas - that influence the policy climate and agenda-setting by illuminating, supporting and challenging existing paradigms

Nice description of methods

``influential public health researchers are rarely just curiosity-driven producers of research that ``speaks for itself''. Rather, they are strategists with a keen awareness of the applied nature of public health who have moved beyond a scientific modus operandi towards a more contemporary research paradigm''

``Linear, rational depictions of the `the policy cycle' are increasingly viewed as idealised normative models that poorly describe a far messier social process (Greenhalgh, 2006, Hanney et al., 2003, Lewis, 2006).''

``The literature focuses on three broad issues: 
- the nature of the research (e.g., relevance, utility, timeliness), 
- the way that it is presented or disseminated (e.g., accessibility, narrative pull, producer-push activities) and 
- the communicative relationship between policymakers and researchers as they struggle to bridge the their `different worlds' Caplan, 1979;Innvaer et al., 2002];Lomas, 2000''

intersting findings include:
- different archetypes of researcher: traditional versus contemporary
- intersection with policy and how this was achieved
- intersection with other worlds, particularly media [curiously in CAN this would be industry, citizenry]
- strongly different opinions on the role of advocacy
- emphasis on relationships between researchers and policymakers},

``On the one hand, and quite predictably, we collected evidence of a deep intrinsic motivation associated with scientific work, a motivation that was based on highly challenging and skilled work located in a field of endeavour with high moral value. On the other hand, our analysis identified a pattern of dissatisfaction associated with recent shifts in the organisation of the labour process and its management.''

Were able to identify people in roles that corresponded to Cotgrove and Box's (1970) ideal types:
- public scientists - pursuit of knowledge
- private scientists - application of knowledge
- organisational scientists - e.g. project managers (often they'd started as public or private scientists)

Change to a Next Steps agency with more commercial focus affected working experiences and resulting employee make up of organisation:
- dissonance between aims of works (publicly oriented) and aims of organisation (commercial)
- drop in commitment and loyalty of research scientists
- loss of technical understanding of the work at the top of the organisation
- greater focus on short term research
- declining autonomy

This paper emphasises the importance of a people-centred approach for policy makers to achieve net zero effectively and rapidly while being alert to citizens’ needs and concerns. We advocate a comprehensive and inclusive public engagement strategy, discussing insights on four key questions to guide policymakers in developing successful engagement strategies. (1) How do climate-friendly social transformations happen?, (2) How can behavioural change for net zero be supported? (3) How can people be involved in decision-making on net zero?, and (4) How does climate change intersect with other societal challenges? We conclude with clear policy recommendations: government leadership at all levels (national, devolved, local), underpinned by a public engagement strategy for net zero, is needed in addition to fair and consistent policies that are transparent about the scale of action needed.},

Present a heuristic model of change that involves four phases: 
- exploitation
- conservation
- creative destruction
- renewal

which constitute an adaptive cycle

Change is episodic, caused by interactions of fast and slow variables

Attributes occur differently at different scales, the shift from processes at one range of scales to another is nonlinear

Stabilising and destabilising forces interact - both are vital to different aspects (productivity and biogeochemical cycles versus diversity, resilience and opportunity)

Management and policies much be flexible, adaptive and experimental

Resilience has two definitions
- efficiency, control, constancy, predictability (engineering resilience) (tractable mathematics, equilibrium steady state, deductive)
- persistence, adaptiveness, variability, unpredictability (ecosystem resilience) (applied maths and ecology, inductive)

The latter is at the heart of designing for sustainability

Traditional ecosystem succession has two functions
 - exploitation (rapid colonisation) - r phase
- conservation (accumulation and storage) - K phase

Likens these to entrepreneurial market and bureaucratic hierarchy
Later understandings add
- release (caused by agents of disturbance such as wildfire; creative destruction) - $\Omega$ phase
- reorganisation (innovation and restructuring) - $\alpha$ phase

Each shift in the cycle between phases changes the 
- potential (for change, what is possible), and 
- connectedness (how much system controls its own destiny)

within the system. There is a 3rd dimension that increases and decreases during the succession:
- resilience (vulnerability to unexpected disturbances)

Novelty and experimentation are possible when connectedness is low and resilience is high - at the transition from the $\alpha$ and r phases, which is a phase of great uncertainty [is this similar to the transition phase described in Geels2004?]

Apply the metaphor to ecological and economic/organisational systems. "Fail" to discover useful exceptions in specific large human organisations. Do identify some exceptions in physical, biological and some human systems [c.f. KayK2020 ``absence of volatility is not absence of risk p421-2''].

The second contribution is to suggest an analytical distinction between systems, actors involved in them, and the institutions which guide actor's perceptions and activities. Thirdly, the article opens up the black box of institutions, making them an integral part of the analysis. Institutions should not just be used to explain inertia and stability. They can also be used to conceptualise the dynamic interplay between actors and structures. The fourth contribution is to address issues of change from one system to another.

``discourse is defined here as an ensemble of ideas, concepts, and categories through which meaning is given to social and physical phenomena, and which is produced and reproduced through an identifiable set of practices''

Crucial to also examine those instances in which some contributions are ruled is - institutional discourse constructs the problem in a particular way

Metaphors are used [I think these are like short hand] - ``acid rain'' is the example

Story lines form a narrative: people convey facts in story form, condensed narrative, assuming a more complex narrative is available to the mind if the receiver, but the assumption of mutual understanding may be false

Discourse coalition share use of a particular set of story lines

Assessing influence of story lines allows power and dominance to be analysed. As story lines begin to dominate there is discourse structuration, ultimately when it becomes dominant and solidified into his institutions operate there is discourse institutionalisation

Example of air pollution which was originally an urban problem (smog) and this way of seeing it had to be broken for it to be understood as a rural problem (acid rain)

An emblem has a central role in facilitating much more than a change in policy it can bring about conceptual shift

Gives 10 steps for undertaking the analysis

- traditional pragmatism - problem was not with UK which has proud record of pollution abatement
- ecological modernisation - UK is dirty old man of Europe, proud record is anachronism

Around the mid-1980s, substantial parts of SPIS started to coalesce into a more coherent field centred on the adoption of an evolutionary (or neo-Schumpeterian) economics framework, an interactive model of the innovation process, and (a little later) the concept of `systems of innovation' and the resource-based view of the firm.

SPIS definition from the Research Policy journal: ``devoted to analyzing, understanding and effectively responding to the economic, policy, management, organizational, environmental and other challenges posed by innovation, technology, R\&D and science. This includes a number of related activities concerned with the creation of knowledge (through research), the diffusion and acquisition of knowledge (e.g. through organizational learning), and its exploitation in the form of new or improved products, processes or services''

``characterised by the terms innovation, technology, R\&D and science, is studied using a range of social science disciplines (economics and economic history, policy studies, management science, organisational studies, sociology''

economics, economic history and business history, policy, management (including new product management), organsiational studies, sociology of innovation - especially diffusion but less sociology of science and technology because this comes more under science and technology studies (STS).

SPIS is possibly a discipline in its own right (p1237) to the point that it is now rare to have articles written by people in industry. [iz: is this good?]

Go into detail on the pros and cons of their method (p1222)

Using these quantitative measures of impact, this paper says that despite being a ``relatively new and still quite small field'' it has make a ``significant number of advances comparable in impact [to] economics'' p1222

Should return to for very short summaries of key papers, developments and authors in the field. 

Idea of ``science push'' linear model of innovation which arose from Vannevar Bush's influential [1945] science policy report to the US Government entitled Science the Endless Frontier.

Schmookler 1966 ``Invention and economics growth is credited with the demand-pull model'' of innovation.

``Kline and Rosenberg [1986] ... effectively ended the `science-push' versus `demand-pull' debate ... argued that one needed to move beyond simple linear models and instead put forward an interactive `chain-linked' model of the innovation process''

Nelson and Arrow on economics of research.

''Knowledge industry'' including patents and much more from Machlup which became known as knowledge economy.

Heller and eisenburg [1998] Patents can give rise to 'anti-commons' because they deter innovation.

Vernon 1966 Product-cycle theory of trade, four stage model of the product cycle in which new goods are developed in industrialised countries and spread to developing countries.

Organisational learning, learning organisation, intelligent enterprise - ideas developed around firms that are able to develop and apply innovations.

Organisational psychology has contributed work around stimulation of the productivity of researchers ``autonomy, interaction with colleagues, the balance between pure and applied research, and some degree of tension between personal and organisational goals''.

''early 1980s witnessed the emergence of what has gradually become for many a common conceptual framework based around evolutionary economics, the interactive model of the innovation process, and, a little later, the notion of `systems of innovation' and the resource-based view of the firm''

''Kanter [1983], ... demonstrated how overly `segmentalist' management could create barriers to innovation, contrasting this with a more integrative style of management which is likely to result in productivity improvement and innovation''.

''Drucker [1985] focused on Innovation and Entrepreneurship, arguing that entrepreneurship is not a specialist talent of a few gifted individuals but is pervasive in a healthy society, not just in the private sector but also in public service organisations. He also warned against infatuation with new technology-based innovation to the detriment of often more important social innovations''. Later (1993) ``argued that we are witnessing the emergence of `post-capitalist society', in which the primary resource for creating wealth is knowledge''.

''Piore and Sabel {1984}, who argued that capitalism had reached a turning-point, where it has to choose between two alternatives - to continue along the existing trajectory of mass-production technology (the course chosen at the first `industrial divide'), or to switch towards craft-based production and exploiting computer technology to make possible `flexible specialisation', thus creating an environment in which firms compete on the basis of innovations but cooperate with regard to developing the necessary technological knowledge and skills.''

''resource-based view of the firm as an alternative to the transaction-cost theory of the firm''. ```in-house knowledge of technology' as one of a firm's key resources''

Related to systems of innovation: Etzkowitz and Leydesdorff 2000 triple helix: universities, industry and government. Universities were initially for teaching, then `first academic revolution' they took on the function of research in the 19th Century, now 'second academic revolution' when taking on `third mission' of contributing to the economy and society. [izz: each revolution has downplayed the importance of those earlier roles].

Gibbons et al [1994] knowledge production can be Mode 1 - universal theories, basic research - and Mode 2 - applications. [Iz: debate about which came first, in fact]

Some of this has come out of particular institutions, e.g. SPRU (and Project SAPPHO), PREST at Manchester University, Centre for Policy Alternatives at MIT, Harvard. The list of highly cited publications is heavily dominated by US-based authors although this papers suggests a range of reason why they may be.

Policy created within relatively closed policy communities ``policy sub-systems'' - public servants and politicians, organized pressure groups, firms, trade unions, journalists, academics and, at times, concerned citizens

Beliefs are the fundamental elements driving policy - information is important, journalists key transmitters - material interests less important - coalitions form where beleifs converge or overlap

Policy change needs to be examined over long periods of time at least 10 years' data

The heart of the framework is its model of beliefs that is based on, or inspired by, Lakatos's (1978) account of scientific belief systems. Human belief systems have 3 elements:
- core beliefs
  - deep core beliefs - strongly held and stable (e.g. ideology)
  - policy core beliefs - relatively stable (e.g. policy implementation assumptions, role of state)
- secondary or peripheral beliefs - change over time (e.g. funding, delivery, implementation specifics)

Problems:
1. little attention to framing however environment may be interpretated by beliefs - manner in which people take in information and assess evidence is affected by their core beliefs - which makes compromise across groups with diverse core beliefs impossible because perception of empirical evidence differs
2. concentration on conscious beliefs when it is likely that core beliefs are not always known
3. or are misperceived so surveys alone should be used with care, measure through behaviour

Discusses the hypotheses that arise out of this framework and how there is not much empirical evidence for them [but they make some intuitive sense], although stark exceptions can be found

nice antidote to approaches that concentrate upon material self-interest and bargaining driving all policy ... [but] belief-driven hypotheses of the ACF seem trivial when exposed to critical analysis},

A fantastic summary and critical review of each of the theories, as well as references to how they've been applied and how they've been developed since first proposed. After the review of the theories, discusses how they can be applied as well as identifying two gaps in the theory as applied to transition studies. I've read this twice - see all my underlines in my reMarkable copy!

Many of the frameworks focus on coalitions but have different perspectives on what is the ``glue'' that holds them together.

Also links several with Geels multi layer perspective (MLP)

Theories:
- Advocacy coalitions framework (ACF, Sabatier and colleagues) - within a given policy subsystem, defined as including all actors which regularly participate in policy formulation processes in a given policy field, there are several advocacy coalitions (consensus is around beliefs), consisting of public and private actors, which are competing for influence on policymaking, one coalition is often dominant. Policy change comes from policy learning, negotiation, external and internal shocks in the subsystem, and macro-features such as f linked sub-systems, public opinion, and policymaking venues
- Multiple streams approach (MSA, Kingdon, Zahariadis) - three streams in policy systems (problems, policy/solutions, and politics), window of opportunity, policy entrepreneur, solutions chase problems, policy dynamics over time (see Kingdon1993), Howlett 2016 add process and programme stream to include policy implementation 
- Punctuated equilibrium theory (PET, Baumgartner, mentioned in WeimerV2015), a dynamic between the politics of subsystems and the macro politics of Congress and the Presidency, thereby normally militating against change but sometimes reinforcing it, policymakers are boundedly rational
- Discourse coalitions (DC, Hajer2005) - a rich diversity of  approaches that focus on narratives, discourses, or frames, actors define issues through shared discourses influences their recognition as public policy problem and the subsequent policy response, story lines, best story, does not consider institutional context and so other work has extended DC, including Arts 2006  discourses, actors, power and rules, Smith and Kern 2009 `` argued that a coalition of policymakers, academics and consultants co-developed a powerful transitions storyline with sufficient interpretive flexibility to appear attractive and non-threatening for policymakers and businesses''
- Policy feedback theory (PFT, Pierson) - ``[the creation of new policies] occurs in a context that is deeply influenced by already existing policies'', feedbacks are resource effects and interpretative effects

2 generic shortcomings:
- largely neglected to explicitly address messy, real-world policy mixes
- studies rarely consider the impact of policy processes and policy outputs on sociotechnical change

Grand challenges need to go beyond policy mixes and consider their interactions},

Assumptions of CBA include:
- Marginality - the change won't affect prices, the existence of goods, relationships between economic vaiables, the rules of economic behaviours, etc
- Homogeneity - the actors, their interests and the dimensions of the policy outcomes are not particularly varied
- Certainty - parameters and outcomes are sufficiently well-known

Instead, ROA considers:
- uncertainty - all significant risks and opportunities
- diversity - all the different dimensions and metrics (not trying to aggregate to onw metric which requires subjective judgement)
- disequilibrium - a dynamic assessment of the direction, rate and magnitude of change in the economy

Sets out that:
- market failure is a specific application of market shaping
- CBA is a specific application of ROA
- equilibrium is one of the many possible states of dynamic systems that can be explained by complexity

Provide more details of the steps of ROA - which I would (probably naively) summarise as systems mapping and analysis

Outlines the key differences between CBA and ROA, in terms of dimensions, input scope, focus, output scope, directionality and threshold of viability

Considers problems of non-marginal change and discusses them in terms of disequilibrium, uncertainty and diversity:
- climate change minigation and low-carbon innocation
- policy for preparing for and responding to a pandemic
- regional development and `levelling up''

Illustrates how CBA and ROA arrive at different conclusions when considering policy options for replacing coal. Using CBA, Frank (2014) found that gas was the best alternative, followed by hydroelectric and nuclear, with wind and solar last. ROA would have considered much more around the energy system, including opportunties for structural change, the reductions in costs due to learning-by-doing, economies of scale and development of complementary technologies.

``An ROA might be more qualified in its conclusions [than was Frank's (2014) CBA], as it would recognise the inherent subjectivity in the relative weighting given to each potential outcome in their different dimensions. However, it is not difficult to see how an ROA could come to a different conclusion to that of the CBA in this case. On the dimension of electricity costs alone, the ROA might conclude that support for solar power was the most cost-effective option; wind the second, and gas the least''},

Analyzing the mechanisms for these extreme consequences could help galvanize action, improve resilience, and inform policy, including emergency responses. We outline current knowledge about the likelihood of extreme climate change, discuss why understanding bad-to-worst cases is vital, articulate reasons for concern about catastrophic outcomes, define key terms, and put forward a research agenda. The proposed agenda covers four main questions: 1) What is the potential for climate change to drive mass extinction events? 2) What are the mechanisms that could result in human mass mortality and morbidity? 3) What are human societies' vulnerabilities to climate-triggered risk cascades, such as from conflict, political instability, and systemic financial risk? 4) How can these multiple strands of evidence—together with other global dangers—be usefully synthesized into an “integrated catastrophe assessment”?

Background
Human impacts on earth-system processes are overshooting several planetary boundaries, driving a crisis of ecological breakdown. This crisis is being caused in large part by global resource extraction, which has increased dramatically over the past half century. We propose a novel method for quantifying national responsibility for ecological breakdown by assessing nations' cumulative material use in excess of equitable and sustainable boundaries.
Methods
For this analysis, we derived national fair shares of a sustainable resource corridor. These fair shares were then subtracted from countries' actual resource use to determine the extent to which each country has overshot its fair share over the period 1970-2017. Through this approach, each country's share of responsibility for global excess resource use was calculated.
Findings
High-income nations are responsible for 74\% of global excess material use, driven primarily by the USA (27\%) and the EU-28 high-income countries (25\%). China is responsible for 15\% of global excess material use, and the rest of the Global South (ie, the low-income and middle-income countries of Latin America and the Caribbean, Africa, the Middle East, and Asia) is responsible for only 8\%. Overshoot in higher-income nations is driven disproportionately by the use of abiotic materials, whereas in lower-income nations it is driven disproportionately by the use of biomass.
Interpretation
These results show that high-income nations are the primary drivers of global ecological breakdown and they need to urgently reduce their resource use to fair and sustainable levels. Achieving sufficient reductions will likely require high-income nations to adopt transformative post-growth and degrowth approaches.
Funding
None.},

Synthesizing paleoclimate, observational, and model-based studies, we provide a revised shortlist of global “core” tipping elements and regional “impact” tipping elements and their temperature thresholds. Current global warming of ~1.1°C above preindustrial temperatures already lies within the lower end of some tipping point uncertainty ranges. Several tipping points may be triggered in the Paris Agreement range of 1.5 to \&lt;2°C global warming, with many more likely at the 2 to 3°C of warming expected on current policy trajectories. This strengthens the evidence base for urgent action to mitigate climate change and to develop improved tipping point risk assessment, early warning capability, and adaptation strategies. Climate tipping points are conditions beyond which changes in a part of the climate system become self-perpetuating. These changes may lead to abrupt, irreversible, and dangerous impacts with serious implications for humanity. Armstrong McKay et al. present an updated assessment of the most important climate tipping elements and their potential tipping points, including their temperature thresholds, time scales, and impacts. Their analysis indicates that even global warming of 1°C, a threshold that we already have passed, puts us at risk by triggering some tipping points. This finding provides a compelling reason to limit additional warming as much as possible. —HJS Global warming greater than 1.5°C could trigger multiple climate tipping points.},

``Those who are arguing that 1.5°C is lost - as well as those still defending its
prospects - are seeking to influence what societies do in response to the deepening climate and ecological crisis''

Arguments that 1.5 is still alive can slow the pace of change and emphasise only incremental action (``stay on course'') or even create some of the ``discourses in climate delay''. Alternatively, arguments that 1.5 is lost may attempt to be a ``wake-up call' to shock society into transformative change, although this risks possibly also creating an appetite for technological solutions (which slows actions) or perhaps just kills action, because the barriers are insurmountable. The many narratives all have agendas and risks. ``In reality, transformational change is not being achieved and so the chance that the 1.5°C goal will be missed is growing''.

Set out a range of hypotheses based on these theories and perform meta analysis to test against 205 emprircal studies in the literature which analyse the effects of organisational feedback

Carnegie perspective -> bounded rationality (Simon, Cyert, March) - organisational
In line with Prospect Theory (which is theory of individual choice): predicts loss aversion for performance below aspirations and risk aversion for performance above aspirations, with the value function being concave for gains and convex for losses and about twice as steep for losses as for gains (Kahneman, Tversky, Greve)

``decision behavior is likely also influenced by individual differences. Such differences can be demographic, for instance, the decision-maker's age, gender, education, disposition, affect, mood, or information processing (Trepel et al., 2005; Pachur et al., 2008, 2017; Hönl et al., 2017; Gächter et al., 2022)'' [sensemaking / orientation ?]

Other individual differences that affect decision making are (gives citations for these):
- self-efficacy
- power
- narcissism
- regulatory focus
- overconfidence

Behavioral Agency Model (BAM) (Wiseman and Gomez-Mejia, 1998) (individual incentives) predicts that executives will react conservatively to organizational performance above aspirations because they expect a gain in wealth  (Wiseman and Gomez-Mejia, 1998) and any additional risk-taking on behalf of the organization might jeopardize this personal gain. When firm performance is below aspirations, decision-makers anticipate loss to personal wealth and, due to loss aversion, are willing to engage in greater organizational risk-taking.

Codes up the reports (another useful example of qualitative analysis) and performs correlation between perfomance and decision maker response

From the results they argue:
- decision-makers overestimate the quality of their competance regarding knowledge gained by job experience, have many biases and thus they are less open to performance feedback (self-enhancing interpretation of performance feedback)
- decision makers with high domain expertise are less prone to such biases because they have gained codified knowledge with more explicit rules (more likely to perform problemistic search with performance below aspirations)
- incentives make decision makers less complacent when performance is above aspirations, but also less ambitious and less risk-taking and as such are more likely to search for solutions

Seems to be testing hypotheses in ZolloW2002 but doesn't cite that paper},

  abstract         = {Decision-making under uncertainty is important for managing human-natural systems in a changing world. A major source of uncertainty is linked to the multi-actor settings of decisions with poorly understood values, complex relationships, and conflicting management approaches. Despite general agreement across disciplines on co-producing knowledge for viable and inclusive outcomes in a multi-actor context, there is still limited conceptual clarity and no systematic understanding on what co-production means in decision-making under uncertainty and how it can be approached. Here, we use content analysis and clustering to systematically analyse 50 decision-making cases with multiple time and spatial scales across 26 countries and in 9 different sectors in the last decade to serve two aims. The first is to synthesise the key recurring strategies that underpin high quality decision co-production across many cases of diverse features. The second is to identify important deficits and opportunities to leverage existing strategies towards flourishing co-production in support of decision-making. We find that four general strategies emerge centred around: promoting innovation for robust and equitable decisions; broadening the span of co-production across interacting systems; fostering social learning and inclusive participation; and improving pathways to impact. Additionally, five key areas that should be addressed to improve decision co-production are identified in relation to: participation diversity; collaborative action; power relationships; governance inclusivity; and transformative change. Characterising the emergent strategies and their key areas for improvement can help guide future works towards more pluralistic and integrated science and practice.},
  comment          = {Interesting paper characterising approaches to co-production for decision making.

Analyse 50 cases of decision-making that involved multi-actor settings. Identified 9 features in 3 groups, each feature has 4 qualitative levels:
- Motivation
  - Framing (problem formulation, decision scoping, ...)
  - Solving (assessing scenarios, evaluating options, ...)
  - Acting (implementing, communication, monitoring, ...)
- Setting
  - Actor (stakeholder groups)
  - Timing (when, frequency)
  - Interaction (direction of information circulation)
- Impact (intended)
  - Power (ability to create/resist change, influence, conflict, cooperation)
  - Politics (governance, who should do what)
  - Change (guidance of transformation on the ground)

From these they identified 4 clusters, types of strategy:
- Innovation (often universities working with societal actors, mainly eliciting information, limited opportunities for social learning and bottom-up co-production)
- Diversification (broadening span of actors e.g. with real world problems, funded beyond science programmes, organisations beyond universities, knowledge exchange between experts, decision makers and citizens, mostly theorising and informing policy)
- Collaboration (social learning, common ground through negotiation, wider actor groups include often marginalised, inform policy but less co-manage transformation)
- Transformation (thinking through change and guiding implementation, understanding of power, actors expectations and responsibilities)

Draw on several best practice cases to identify challenges and their opportunities. The 5 opportunties are:
- Create trusted knowledge from multiple sources
- Empower learning and collaboration
- Understand and manage power dynamics with all actors
- Account for politics and inclusive governance
- Link knowledge with action for transformative change

Conclude that there may be more strategies to discover through future studies and that no single right way to do co-production of decisions},

  comment          = {Carbon must not become the new GDP. Metrics are part of colonialism and capitalism. Great overview of history of GDP and problems with GDP as a measure of economy because it is a model that doesn't fit everywhere and it makes many things invisible, oversimplified and overcertain.
''A history of environmental policy as the history of forgotten alternatives has not yet been written.''

''What are the implications, if «carbon» becomes the accounting unit of society? What are the implications for dealing with the crisis of nature? Does it foster or hinder a turnaround in policy and mentality?''

''GDP hogs the limelight like an all-powerful autocrat, bathing the money economy in its glare and consigning the non-economic values to darkness.''
''Is there a risk of a similar trajectory - from innovation via custom to frustration - if «carbon» is made the negative measure of prosperity for all societies?''

''Is climate change more important and more urgent than the loss of biodiversity, the degradation of arable soils, or the depletion of fresh water? Can any of these phenomena even be considered in isolation from each other?''

''the way we describe and frame a problem very much predetermines the kinds of solutions and answers that we can consider''

''It is important to keep in mind that the products of just ninety private companies, state-owned enterprises and government-run industries (including the biggest producers of coal, oil, gas and cement) are responsible for two thirds of global emissions to the atmosphere since the beginning of industrialization (www.carbonmajors.org)''

''green growth strategies try to take a short cut to solving the environmental crises by relying on one single measurable unit. Carbon metrics are a scale for environmental injustice; they are thought to offer a universal lens to see the world and the problems we face (as we live in a CO2 society) and anchor a consistent indicator for environmental degradation; and they are thought to offer a policy tool to change the world.''

''The assumed objectivity of counting environmental and economic global issues (be it carbon or GDP) can not be detached from the risk of over-simplifying complex issues, thus making opaque - or even invisible - major issues of power.''

Likens carbon metrics to calorie counting as well as GDP.

''global abstractions need to be assessed in epistemological (i.e. cognitive) and political terms as well as with regard to their respective historical contexts.''

''The apprehension of reality in calculable units lies at the core of the way in which we think today. It is the reason why we can frame - and reduce - key political issues of our times in terms of a calculation of costs and benefits, and, for example, talk about climate change in terms of the «price of inaction» (and the opportunities and profits of action), or translate a major ecological crisis into the management of carbon units.''

''Each gas has distinct values according to its Global Warming Potential (GWP) or Global Temperature change Potential (GTP)''

''common metric such as the «CO2 equivalent» allows us to put emissions of all greenhouses gases on a commensurable scale. Ideally, the same equivalent CO2 emissions would produce the same climate effect, regardless of which gases contribute to that equivalent CO2 and irrespective of the geo-social circumstances of its emission.''

*''Undoubtedly, the environmental crisis we face is real and deeply serious. But it is also multidimensional and highly complex in the way it influences the interdependent interactions that constitute the delicate and intricate web of planetary life.''

''Is it assumed that all these multidimensional aspects of the man-made environmental challenge facing us not only correlate, but can also be tackled and solved by simply addressing the concentration of carbon dioxide (CO2) in parts per million in the atmosphere?''

''The Pope clearly voiced opposition to «the buying and selling of carbon credits» because in his view it leads to a «new form of speculation which will not help reduce the emission of polluting gases worldwide». The Pope has been criticized for making this point, because carbon trade stands as the economist's favored path to change''

''While we see carbon as a new metric making its way into all dimensions of social life, we observe the emergence of a new commodity in the form of «carbon rights».'' - have the same impact on world history as ``the enclosure of formally communual land into private holding of land titles''

''when Europe was in disarray due to the devastation caused by World War Two....the reconstruction of whole national economies captured global political imagination in a way that is comparable to today's focus on carbon.''
''Counting carbon simplifies this challenge and gives politicians the illusion that they can do something against environmental degradation''

''The immediate phase post-1945 produced [four] innovations .... 
1. novel institutions of global politics such as the United Nations founded in San Francisco in 1945 ...
2. Before the rise of international organizations, global political debate was the realm of smart diplomats who were trained in diplomatic protocol, in legal studies and international law. After World War Two, technical experts, for example in agriculture, health or education, started to accompany the national diplomatic delegations at international meetings ...
3. turning all political questions into economic issues [e.g. Keynes] ... «economic imperialism» ... is conquering all neighboring disciplines and currently also colonizes all concerns about the environment ...
4. post-1945 ... the shift of political issues into a quantitative mode.''
''The measurement of carbon emissions is being objectified since the 1992 Rio Conference''

Excellent history of GDP (page 29)
''During the Early Modern Epoch the secular European intellectual elites began to separate their immediate sensual experience of the natural environment from an analytical approach to nature. This move has been termed a «great bifurcation» that became the foundation of the modern sciences. Its core was the laboratory.''

''So there are always two trajectories involved in modern science: one is the isolation part, which means the shutting of the laboratory's doors, the reduction of complexity and the creation of invisibility. The other part is the innovation that brings new insights to the fore.''

''Social scientists took some time to catch up with this hard epistemic model''

''The widely held assumption that numbers are the «hard facts» of the real world needs to be refuted.''

Economic models don't work everywhere, e.g. Phyllis Dean found that areas were largely dominated by subsistence production and barter trade. And in other areas it is difficult to separate production and consumption.

''the «valuation» of environmental system services might lead to a more sustainable global economy. But it will also prolong capitalist exploitation by allowing those in power to accumulate newly established «carbon rights» and control over ecosystems in the Global South''

''«technical» recommendations about the economic benefits of investment and adoption of low-carbon technologies, such as those attributed to biofuels, served as a key trigger for the land grabbing boom that followed the release and impact of the report, with consequences on land price speculation, evictions, expansion of monocultures, .hunger, etc''

''The failure to recognize the different ways of knowing by which people across the globe run their lives and provide meaning to their existence is termed «cognitive injustice», or «epistemicide» (Boaventura de Souza Santos).''..global social justice is not possible without global cognitive justice''

''How can we debunk the myth that we can have «zero-net emissions» accountancy (an urgent matter in light of the Paris Agreement.)?''
''How can we dismantle the growth mantra? How can we regulate those industries that destroy and pollute and how can we prevent their lobbyists from simply buying political decisions in their favor?''

''We need to challenge our mental infrastructures''},
